asterisk-common: all asterisk related configuration that is known to work with both asterisk 1.4 and 1.6

telephony: asterisk reference code for 1.4 and 1.6 and legacy dialogic code including DOS exe files.

Installing: this has been installed on ubuntu 10.04 LTS, centos 5 and centos 7
the web tools depend on the apache2, php5, php5-mysql ubuntu packages
the telephony interface depends on the libdbd-mysql-perl ubuntu package as well as perl
both of them depend on mysql being installed. Example install command (run as root): 

	aptitude install apache2 mysql-client mysql-server libdbd-mysql-perl php5 php5-cli php5-mysql libncurses-dev ncurses-dev

or for centos 5

	yum install ncurses-devel ncurses glibc zlib php php-cli php-pdo mariadb perl-DBD-mysql

or for centos 7

	yum install ncurses-libs.i686 glibc.i686 zlib.i686 php php-cli php-pdo mariadb perl-DBD-mysql

and some rpm packages for the asterisk 1.4 build on centos 7 (from centos 5 originally)

	rpm -i --nodeps libtermcap-2.0.8-46.1.i386.rpm 
	rpm -i --nodeps libtermcap-devel-2.0.8-46.1.i386.rpm 

(the glibc/termcap/ncurses packages are required for asterisk to build)

Even with this check that /usr/lib/libtermcap.so is a valid link. For asterisk 1.6 on centos 7 I had 
to run configure with an explicit environment variable to get it to work:

	TERMCAP_LIB=/usr/lib/libtermcap.so ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/asterisk-1.6

Also for asterisk 1.6 it will want libxml2:

	sudo yum install libxml2.i686 libxml2-devel.i686

To force 32 bit a build makeopts in the asterisk build directory needed to be changed. See the 
makeopts.example files for what was changed. This avoids errors when asterisk starts:

	asterisk/lib/asterisk/modules/func_devstate.so: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64



See the asterisk-common/README and telephony/README for details on installing the asterisk
server and web tools/agi interface respectively. See the CRON file for various crontabs used
by different servers. The system will mostly work without any cron jobs except that boxes
that are out of service will not get cleaned up.p
