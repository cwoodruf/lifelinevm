asterisk-common: all asterisk related configuration that is know to work with both asterisk 1.4 and 1.6

telephony: asterisk reference code for 1.4 and 1.6 and legacy dialogic code including DOS exe files.

Installing: this has been installed on ubuntu 10.04 LTS 
the web tools depend on the apache2, php5, php5-mysql ubuntu packages
the telephony interface depends on the libdbd-mysql-perl ubuntu package as well as perl
both of them depend on mysql being installed. Example install command (run as root): 

aptitude install apache2 mysql-client mysql-server libdbd-mysql-perl php5 php5-cli php5-mysql libncurses-dev ncurses-dev

(the ncurses packages seem to be required for asterisk to build)

See the asterisk-common/README and telephony/README for details on installing the asterisk
server and web tools/agi interface respectively. See the CRON file for various crontabs used
by different servers. The system will mostly work without any cron jobs except that boxes
that are out of service will not get cleaned up.
