dialogic: 

This is the legacy dialogic software for Lifeline. It was designed to run on old 286, 386 and 486 systems.
This will only work with the old D/41d, Dialog/4, Proline/2v etc cards that used the old dialogic api.
The dialogic driver software that we used ran on DOS and the Windows 98 family of operating (somewhat) 
systems. The application is quite stable on these old systems and can be left running for months on
end. 

However ... the source code is pretty messy and was going to be refactored into modules but at that 
point the hardware was already obsolete. It was developed with MSVC++ version 1.5.

While the hardware may be obsolete it can still be bought on ebay. Finding computers with ISA slots
is getting more difficult unless you want to spend a great deal of money to get one built.

An emulation layer for this old dialogic API would probably be a useful project at some point.

asterisk-1.4, asterisk-1.6:

This is a reference build of asterisk that is known to work. Its identical to 1.4.32 but contains
the apps/app_recordkeys.c (RecordKeys) asterisk application that can branch based on used input
while recording. RecordKeys is not part of the current asterisk distribution but I have send along
a patch: https://issues.asterisk.org/view.php?id=17487

This version of RecordKey also differs from Record in that it does not automatically delete 
messages and stop the application on hang up.

Both key capture and tolerant hang up are needed to make the user interface less confusing for
people who are not comfortable working with IVR systems.

I am running asterisk as the user asterisk in its own tree.

The configure commands used to make the versions of asterisk were:

cd asterisk-1.4 && \
./configure --with-gsm=internal --prefix=/usr/local/asterisk-1.4 --enable-dev-mode

cd asterisk-1.6 && \
./configure --with-gsm=internal --prefix=/usr/local/asterisk-1.6 --enable-dev-mode

Then 

make && sudo su -c 'make install' asterisk

I used a symlink /usr/local/asterisk to default to a specific version of asterisk (1.4 currently).

Other notes:

* The "--enable-dev-mode" option is probably not essential typically.

* You may need to remove the menuselect.makeopts if you rebuild with a new version of asterisk

* Version 1.6 changed substantially from June 2010 to January 2011 and may change substantially again.
  This may mean having to manually update apps/app_readkey.c and apps/app_readkeys.c if there are major
  updates in the future. 1.4 thankfully isn't being actively worked on.
