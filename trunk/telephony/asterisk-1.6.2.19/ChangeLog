	* apps/app_confbridge.c: ConfBridge does not handle hangup properly
	  When playing back a prompt to a channel, confbridge neglects to
	  check for hangup events causing lockup condititions for hangups
	  that occur before actually joining the conference. This change
	  ensures that the user is removed from the conference in the event
	  of a premature hangup. Review:

	  2011) | 25 lines Resolve a segfault/bus error when we try to map
	  memory that falls on a page boundary. The fix for ASTERISK-15359
	  was incorrect in that it added 1 to the length of the mmap'd
	  region. The problem with this is that reading/writing to that
	  extra byte outside of the bounds of the underlying fd causes a
	  bus error. The real issue is that we are working with both a FILE
	  * and the raw fd underneath it and not synchronizing between
	  them. The code that was removed in ASTERISK-15359 was correct,
	  but we weren't flushing the FILE * before mapping the fd. Looking
	  at the manager code in 1.4 reveals that the FILE * in 'struct
	  mansession' is never used except to create a temporary file that
	  we immediately fdopen. This means we just need to write a 0 byte
	  to the fd and everything will just work. The other branches
	  require a call to fflush() which, while not a guaranteed fix,
	  should reduce the likelihood of a crash. This all makes sense in
	  my head. (closes issue ASTERISK-16460) Reported by:

	* channels/chan_sip.c: This commit modifies the way polling is done
	  on TLS sockets. Because of the buffering the TLS layer does,
	  polling is unreliable. If poll is called while there is data
	  waiting to be read in the TLS layer but not at the network layer,
	  the messaging processing engine will not proceed until something
	  else writes data to the socket, which may not occur. This change
	  modifies the logic around TLS sockets to only poll after a failed
	  read on a non-blocking socket. This way we know that there is no
	  data waiting to be read from the buffering layer. (closes issue

	  directed group pickup feature code *8 with pickupsounds enabled
	  Since 1.6.2, the new pickupsound and pickupfailsound in
	  features.conf cause many issues. 1).
	  chan_sip:handle_request_invite() shouldn't be playing out the
	  fail/success audio, as it has 'netlock' locked. 2). dialplan
	  applications for directed_pickups shouldn't beep. 3). feature

	  configured. Created a sip_pickup() thread to handle the pickup
	  and playout the audio, spawned from handle_request_invite. Moved
	  app_directed:pickup_do() to features:ast_do_pickup(). Functions
	  below, all now use the new ast_do_pickup() app_directed_pickup.c:

	  section 18.2.2 by always using the port specified in the Via
	  header for routing responses (even when maddr is not set). Also

	  | 18 lines Allow transfer loops without allowing forwarding loops
	  We try to avoid the situation where two phones may be forwarded
	  to each other causing an infinite loop by storing each dialed
	  interface in a channel datastore and checking the list before
	  dialing out. This works, but currently breaks situations like A
	  calls B, A transfers B to C, B transfers C to A, and A transfers
	  C to B. Since human interaction is happening here and not an
	  automated forwarding loop, it should be allowed. This patch
	  removes the dialed_interfaces datastore when a call is bridged (a
	  suggestion from the brilliant mmichelson). If a call is being
	  bridged, it should be safe to assume that we aren't stuck in a
	  loop. Since we are now handling this is the bridge code, the
	  previous attempts at handling it in app_dial and app_queue are
	  removed. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/1195/

	  up at the right time. The cause was actually a caller hanging up
	  just at the end of the Feature Group D DTMF tones that setup the
	  call. The reason for this is a "guard timer" that's implemented
	  using ast_safe_sleep(100). If the caller happens to hang up AFTER
	  the final tone of the DTMF string but BEFORE the end of that
	  ast_safe_sleep(), then ast_safe_sleep() will return non-zero.
	  This causes the code to bounce to the end of ss_thread(), but it
	  does NOT tear down the call properly. This should be a rare
	  occurrence because the caller has to hang up at EXACTLY the right
	  time. Nonetheless, it was happening quite regularly on the
	  reporter's system. It's not easily reproducible, unless you
	  purposely increase the guard-time to 2000 or more. Once you do
	  that, you can reproduce it every time by watching the DTMF debug
	  and hanging up just as it ends. Simply add an ast_hangup() before
	  goto quit. (closes issue #15671) Reported by: jcromes Patches:

	  | 29 lines Don't delay DTMF in core bridge while listening for
	  DTMF features This patch is mostly the work of Olle Johansson. I
	  did some cleanup and added the silence generating code if
	  transmit_silence is set. When a channel listens for DTMF in the
	  core bridge, the outbound DTMF is not sent until we have received
	  DTMF_END. For a long DTMF, this is a disaster. We send 4 seconds
	  of DTMF to Asterisk, which sends no audio for those 4 seconds.
	  Some products see this delay and the time skew on RTP packets
	  that results and start ignoring the audio that is sent afterward.
	  With this change, the DTMF_BEGIN frame is inspected and checked.
	  If it matches a feature code, we wait for DTMF_END and activate
	  the feature as before. If transmit_silence=yes in asterisk.conf,
	  silence is sent if we paritally match a multi-digit feature. If
	  it doesn't match a feature, the frame is forwarded along with the
	  DTMF_END without delay. By doing it this way, DTMF is not
	  delayed. (closes issue #15642) Reported by: jasonshugart Patches:

	  A framing error in the checksum could be because: 1) The sender

	  carrier too soon. 3) The sender opted to send zero of the
	  specified zero to 10 trailing mark bits and round-off errors in

	  Mar 2011) | 31 lines Add AELSub, which provides a stable entry
	  point into AEL subroutines. This commit needs some explanation,
	  given that we're adding a new application into an existing
	  release branch. This is generally a violation of our release
	  policy, except in very limited circumstances, and I believe this
	  is one of those circumstances. The problem that this solves is
	  one of the sanity of using multiple dialplan languages to define
	  a dialplan. In the case of the reporter, he or she is using AEL
	  is define subroutines, while using Realtime extensions to invoke
	  those subroutines. While you can do this, it's based upon the
	  reality of AEL using actual dialplan extensions; however, there
	  is no guarantee that the details of _how_ AEL is compiled into
	  extensions will remain stable. In fact, at the time of this
	  commit, it has already changed twice, once in a fundamental way.
	  Now normally, a new application would only be added to trunk.
	  However, this application is explicitly to create a stable
	  user-level API between versions, and adding it to trunk only will
	  not solve the user's problem of switching between 1.6.2 and 1.8,
	  nor will it help anybody switching from 1.8 to 1.10. Therefore,
	  it needs to go into existing release branches. For the sake of
	  consistency, and also because one of the changes was between 1.4
	  and 1.6.x, I am also electing to commit this to 1.4. (closes

	  breaks overlap dialing. Issue #16789 was a good idea.
	  Unfortunately, it breaks overlap dialing through Asterisk. There
	  is not enough information available at this point to know if
	  dialing is complete. The ast_exists_extension(),
	  ast_matchmore_extension(), and ast_canmatch_extension() calls are
	  not adequate to detect a dial through extension pattern of "_9!".
	  Workaround is to use the dialplan Proceeding() application early
	  in non-dial through extensions. * Effectively revert issue
	  #16789. * Allow outgoing overlap dialing to hear dialtone and
	  other early media. A PROGRESS "inband-information is now
	  available" message is now sent after the SETUP_ACKNOWLEDGE
	  message for non-digital calls. An AST_CONTROL_PROGRESS is now
	  generated for incoming SETUP_ACKNOWLEDGE messages for non-digital
	  calls. * Handling of the AST_CONTROL_CONGESTION in
	  chan_dahdi/sig_pri was inconsistent with the cause codes. * Added
	  better protection from sending out of sequence messages by
	  combining several flags into a single enum value representing

	  | 31 lines Fix channel redirect out of MeetMe() and other issues
	  with channel softhangup. Mantis issue #18585 reports that a
	  channel redirect out of MeetMe() stopped working properly. This
	  issue includes a patch that resolves the issue by removing a call
	  to ast_check_hangup() from app_meetme.c. I left that in my patch,
	  as it doesn't need to be there. However, the rest of the patch
	  fixes this problem with or without the change to app_meetme. The
	  key difference between what happens before and after this patch
	  is the effect of the END_OF_Q control frame. After END_OF_Q is
	  hit in ast_read(), ast_read() will return NULL. With the
	  ast_check_hangup() removed, app_meetme sees this which causes it
	  to exit as intended. Checking ast_check_hangup() caused
	  app_meetme to exit earlier in the process, and the target of the
	  redirect saw the condition where ast_read() returned NULL.
	  Removing ast_check_hangup() works around the issue in app_meetme,
	  but doesn't solve the issue if another application did the same
	  thing. There are also other edge cases where if an application
	  finishes at the same time that a redirect happens, the target of
	  the redirect will think that the channel hung up. So, I made some
	  changes in pbx.c to resolve it at a deeper level. There are
	  already places that unset the SOFTHANGUP_ASYNCGOTO flag in an
	  attempt to abort the hangup process. My patch extends this to
	  remove the END_OF_Q frame from the channel's read queue, making
	  the "abort hangup" more complete. This same technique was used in
	  every place where a softhangup flag was cleared. (closes issue

	main/features: Use POLLPRI when waiting for events on parked channels.

	This change resolves a regression in the 1.6.2 when converting from
	select to poll. The DAHDI timers use POLLPRI to indicate that the
	timer
	fired, but features was not waiting for that flag. The result was no
	audio for MOH when a call was parked and res_timing_dahdi was in use.

	This patch is slightly modified from the one on the mantis issue. It
	does
	not set an exception on the channel if the POLLPRI flag is set.

	(closes issue 0018262)

	  | 23 lines Fix not stopping MOH when transfered local channel
	  queue member is answered. The problem here is only present when
	  local channels are used with the MOH passthru option as well as
	  no optimization (/nm). I will describe the slightly bizarre
	  scenario that was used to test, where phones B and C are queue
	  members: Phone A dials into a queue with two members using local
	  channels and the above options. Phone B answers. Phone A blind
	  transfers phone B into the same queue. Phone A hangs up. Phone C
	  answers, but phone B didn't stop playing MOH. In this scenario,
	  the unhold frame that should have gotten to phone B never arrived
	  due to the masquerade from the blind transfer. This is usually
	  fine since app_queue manages the starting and stopping of MOH.
	  However, with the passthrough option enabled when app_queue
	  attempts to stop MOH it tries to do so on the local channel
	  rather than the real channel. The easiest solution was to just
	  make sure to send an unhold frame during the transfer since it
	  wouldn't make sense to have MOH playing after a transfer anyway.
	  This only modifies SIP transfers, but the other transfers did not
	  seem to be a problem. If DTMF based transfers were a problem it
	  might be okay to add ast_moh_stop to finishup, but I didn't want
	  to have to add that unless required. ABE-2624 ........

	  with no CID never fails. Also the SIP phone does not hear MOH
	  when the CW call is answered. The DTMF end frame is suppressed
	  when the phone acknowledges the CW signal for CID. The problem is
	  the DTMF begin frame needs to be suppressed as well. The DTMF
	  begin frame is causing SIP to start sending the DTMF RTP frames.
	  Since the DTMF end frame is suppressed, SIP will not stop sending

	  | 38 lines Handle failures building translation paths more
	  effectively. The problem scenario occurred on a heavily loaded
	  system that was using the codec_dahdi module and exceeded the
	  hardware transcoding capacity. The failure mode at that point was
	  not good. The report came in to us as an Asterisk lock-up. The
	  "core show locks" shows a ton of threads locked up (but no
	  obvious deadlock). Upon deeper investigation, when the system is
	  in this state, the CPU was maxed out. The CPU was being consumed
	  by the Asterisk logger spewing messages on every audio frame for
	  calls set up after transcoder capacity was reached. The purpose
	  of this patch is to make Asterisk handle failures to create a
	  translation path in a more graceful manner. If we can't
	  translate, then the call just needs to be dropped, as it's not
	  going to work. These are the changes: 1) In set_format() of
	  channel.c (which is called by set_read_format() and
	  set_write_format()), it was ignoring if
	  ast_translator_build_path() failed and returned NULL. It now pays
	  attention to that case and returns a result reflecting failure.
	  With this change in place, the bridging code will immediately
	  detect a failure and end the bridge instead of proceeding to try
	  to bridge frames that can't be translated and making channel
	  drivers freak out by sending them frames in a format they weren't
	  expecting. 2) In ast_indicate_data() of channel.c, failure of
	  ast_playtones_start() was ignored. It is now reflected in the
	  return value of the function. This didn't turn out to have any
	  affect on the bug, but seemed like a good change to leave in. 3)
	  In app_dial(), when only sending a call to a single endpoint, it
	  will attempt to do some bridging of its own of early audio. It
	  uses make_compatible() when it's going to do this. However, it
	  ignored failure from make compatible. So, even with the fix from
	  #1, if there was early audio going through app_dial, there would
	  still be a period of invalid frames passing through. After
	  detecting failure here, Dial() exits. ABE-2658 ........

	  problem: 1) Party A calls Party B 2) Invoke CLI "channel
	  redirect" command to redirect channel call leg associated with A.
	  3) All associated channels are hung up. Note that if the CLI
	  command were done on the channel call leg associated with B it
	  works. This regression was a result of the fix for issue #16946
	  (https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/740/). The regression affects

	  is a mess. The variable is used for several purposes that do not

	  used. I have corrected all the places where the variable was

	* include/asterisk/event.h, main/event.c: Fix cache of device state
	  changes for multiple servers. This patch addresses a regression
	  where device states across multiple servers were not being
	  processing completely correctly. The code works to determine the
	  overall state by looking at the last known state of a device on
	  each server. However, there was a regression due to some invasive
	  rewrites of how the cache works that led to the cache only
	  storing the last device state change for a device, regardless of
	  which server it was on. The code is set up to cache device state
	  change events by ensuring that each event in the cache has a
	  unique device name + entity ID (server ID). The code that was
	  responsible for comparing raw information elements (which EID is)
	  always returned a match due to a memcmp() with a length of 0.
	  There isn't much code to fix the actual bug. This patch also
	  introduces a new CLI command that was very useful for debugging
	  this problem. The command allows you to dump the contents of the
	  event cache. (closes issue #18284) Reported by: klaus3000

	  peers never stopping. The option packets not only never stopped,
	  but if a realtime peer was not in the peer list multiple options
	  dialogs could accumulate over time. This scenario has the
	  potential to progress to the point of saturating a link just from
	  options packets. The fix was to ensure that the poke scheduler
	  checks to see if a peer is in the peer list before continuing to
	  poke. The reason a peer must be in the peer list to be able to
	  properly manage an options dialog is because otherwise the call
	  pointer is lost when the peer is regenerated from the database,
	  which is how existing qualify dialogs are detected. (closes issue

	  | 47 lines Fix a deadlock in device state change processing.
	  Copied from some notes from the original author (Russell):
	  Deadlock scenario: Thread 1: device state change thread Holds -
	  rdlock on contexts Holds - hints lock Waiting on channels
	  container lock Thread 2: SIP monitor thread Holds the "iflock"
	  Holds a sip_pvt lock Holds channel container lock Waiting for a
	  channel lock Thread 3: A channel thread (chan_local in this case)
	  Holds 2 channel locks acquired within app_dial Holds a 3rd
	  channel lock it got inside of chan_local Holds a local_pvt lock
	  Waiting on a rdlock of the contexts lock A bunch of other threads
	  waiting on a wrlock of the contexts lock To address this
	  deadlock, some locking order rules must be put in place and
	  enforced. Existing relevant rules: 1) channel lock before a pvt
	  lock 2) contexts lock before hints lock 3) channels container
	  before a channel What's missing is some enforcement of the order
	  when you involve more than any two. To fix this problem, I put in
	  some code that ensures that (at least in the code paths involved
	  in this bug) the locks in (3) come before the locks in (2). To
	  change the operation of thread 1 to comply, I converted the
	  storage of hints to an astobj2 container. This allows processing
	  of hints without holding the hints container lock. So, in the
	  code path that led to thread 1's state, it no longer holds either
	  the contexts or hints lock while it attempts to lock the channels
	  container. (closes issue #18165) Reported by: antonio ABE-2583

	  assuming that the default number of samples was in each read. In
	  other words, each packet your provider sent you, regardless of
	  size, would result in 20 ms of decoded data (30 ms if decoding
	  G723). If your provider was sending 60 ms packets then
	  codec_dahdi would end up stripping 40 ms of data from each
	  transcoded frame resulting in "choppy" audio. This would only
	  affect systems where G729 packets are arriving in sizes greater
	  than 20ms or G723 packets arriving in sizes greater than 30ms.

	  correctly restrict max messages. The comparison function logic
	  was off, so the number of sessions for a given mailbox were not
	  being incremented properly. This problem caused the maximum
	  number of messages per folder to not be respected when
	  simultaneously leaving multiple voicemails just below the
	  threshold. These problems should be fixed by the above, but just
	  in case: Fixed resequence_mailbox to rely on the actual number of
	  detected number of files in a directory rather than just assuming
	  only 10 messages more than the maximum had been left. Also if
	  more messages than the maximum are deleted they are actually
	  removed now. The second purpose of this commit should have been
	  separated out probably, but is related to the above. Again, if
	  the number of messages in a given voicemail folder exceeds the
	  maximum set limit make sure to allocate enough space for the
	  deleted and heard index tracking array. A few random fixes: There
	  was a forgotten decrement of the inprocess count in
	  imap_store_file. When using IMAP storage, do not look in the
	  directory where file based storage messages may still reside and
	  influence the message count. Ensure to use only the first format
	  in sendmail. ABE-2516 ........

	  Oct 2010) | 27 lines This patch turns chan_local pvts into
	  astobj2 objects. chan_local does some dangerous things involving
	  deadlock avoidance. tech_pvt functions like hangup and
	  queue_frame are provided with a locked channel upon entry. Those
	  functions are completely safe as long as you don't attempt to
	  give up that channel lock, but that is impossible to guarantee
	  due to the required deadlock avoidance necessary to lock both the
	  tech_pvt and both channels involved. In the past, we have tried
	  to account for this by doing things like setting a "glare" flag
	  that indicates what function should destroy the pvt. This was
	  used in local_hangup and local_queue_frame to decided who should
	  destroy the pvt if they collided in separate threads. I have
	  removed the need to do this by converting all chan_local
	  tech_pvts to astobj2. This means we can ref a pvt before deadlock
	  avoidance and not have to worry about that pvt possibly getting
	  destroyed under us. It also cleans up where we destroy the
	  tech_pvt. The only unlink from the tech_pvt container occurs in
	  local_hangup now, which is where it should occur. Since there
	  still may be thread collisions on some functions like
	  local_hangup after deadlock avoidance, I have added some checks
	  to detect those collisions and exit appropriately. I think this
	  patch is going to solve quite a bit of weirdness we have had with
	  local channels in the past. ........

	  | 21 lines Don't ignore frames that have been queued when
	  softhangup'd When an outgoing call is answered and hung up by the
	  far end *very* quickly, we may not read any frames and therefor
	  end up with a call that displays the wrong
	  disposition/DIALSTATUS. The reason is because ast_queue_hangup()
	  immediately sets the _softhangup flag on the channel and then
	  queues the HANGUP control frame, but __ast_read refuses to read
	  any frames if ast_check_hangup() indicates that a hangup request
	  has been made (which it will if _softhangup is set). So, we end
	  up losing control frames. This change makes __ast_read continue
	  to read frames even if a soft hangup has been requested. It
	  queues a hangup frame to make sure that __ast_read() will still
	  eventually return NULL. Much thanks to David Vossel for all of
	  the reviews, discussion, and help! (closes issue #16946) Reported

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fixes interoperability problems with session
	  timer behavior in Asterisk. CHANGES: 1. Never put "timer" in
	  "Require" header. This is not to our benefit and RFC 4028 section
	  7.1 even warns against it. It is possible for one endpoint to
	  perform session-timer refreshes while the other endpoint does not
	  support them. If in this case the end point performing the
	  refreshing puts "timer" in the Require field during a refresh,
	  the dialog will likely get terminated by the other end. 2. Change
	  the behavior of 'session-timer=accept' in sip.conf (which is the
	  default behavior of Asterisk with no session timer configuration
	  specified) to only run session-timers as result of an incoming
	  INVITE request if the INVITE contains an "Session-Expires"
	  header... Asterisk is currently treating having the "timer"
	  option in the "Supported" header as a request for session timers
	  by the UAC. I do not agree with this. Session timers should only
	  be negotiated in "accept" mode when the incoming INVITE supplies
	  a "Session-Expires" header, otherwise RFC 4028 says we should
	  treat a request containing no "Session-Expires" header as a
	  session with no expiration. Below I have outlined some situations
	  and what Asterisk's behavior is. The table reflects the behavior
	  changes implemented by this patch. SITUATIONS: -Asterisk as UAS
	  1. Incoming INVITE: NO "Session-Expires" 2. Incoming INVITE: HAS
	  "Session-Expires" -Asterisk as UAC 3. Outgoing INVITE: NO
	  "Session-Expires". 200 Ok Response HAS "Session-Expires" header
	  4. Outgoing INVITE: NO "Session-Expires". 200 Ok Response NO
	  "Session-Expires" header 5. Outgoing INVITE: HAS
	  "Session-Expires". Active - Asterisk will have an active refresh
	  timer regardless if the other endpoint does. Inactive - Asterisk
	  does not have an active refresh timer regardless if the other
	  endpoint does. XXXXXXX - Not possible for mode.

	  | 19 lines Fixed how Asterisk destroys a dialog on channel hangup
	  before invite receives a response. If an ast_channel with a SIP
	  tech pvt hangs up before the sip dialog gets a response to its
	  outgoing INVITE, Asterisk used to pretend_ack the INVITE. This is
	  not rfc compliant and results in confusion at the other endpoint.
	  sip_pretend_ack will ack and remove all the packets in the
	  retransmit queue. This means that the INVITE will stop
	  retransmitting, and that any response to that INVITE that comes
	  after the pretend_ack occurs will be ignored. Instead of faking
	  any sort of acknowledgement for an outgoing INVITE during an
	  internal hangup, we should let the protocol stack process the
	  INVITE transaction and terminate the dialog properly. This is
	  achieved by setting the PENDING_BYE flag. When this flag is used,
	  once the dialog proceeds to an escapable state the transaction
	  will either be canceled with a SIP_CANCEL or completed followed
	  immediately by a BYE. Attempting to do this any other way is
	  incorrect. If the endpoint is not responding to the INVITE
	  request, the INVITE must continue to be retransmitted until it
	  times out which will result in the dialog being destroyed.
	  ........

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Add to and from tags to NOTIFY dialog-info
	  xml body so pickup can occur. When pedantic mode is used, the
	  dialog-info xml generated during a ringing event must contain the
	  to and from tag values. Otherwise if a pickup occurs using INVITE
	  with replaces, Astrisk will not be able to locate the
	  subscription.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Asterisk will not advertise session timers
	  are supported when 'session-timers=refuse' is used. Asterisk now
	  dynamically builds the "Supported" header depending on what is
	  enabled/disabled in sip.conf. Session timers used to always be
	  advertised as being supported even when they were disabled in the
	  configuration. This caused problems with some end points. (issue
	  #17005)

	  | 11 lines This fix makes sure the ast_channel hangs up correctly
	  when the dialog's PENDING_BYE flag is set. When the pending bye
	  flag is used, it is possible that the dialog will terminate and
	  leave the sip_pvt->owner channel up. This is because we never
	  hangup the ast_channel after sending the SIP_BYE request. When we
	  receive the response for the SIP_BYE we set need_destroy which we
	  would expect to destroy the dialog on the next do_monitor loop,
	  but this is not the case. The dialog will only be destroyed once
	  the owner is hungup even with the need_destroy flag set. This
	  patch sets the softhangup flag on the ast_channel when a SIP_BYE
	  request is sent as a result of the pending bye flag. ........

	* channels/chan_sip.c: only do magic pickup when notifycid is
	  enabled A new way of doing BLF pickup was introduced into 1.6.2.
	  This feature adds a call-id value into the XML of a SIP_NOTIFY
	  message sent to alert a subscriber that a device is ringing. This
	  option should only be enabled when the new 'notifycid' option is
	  set... but this was not the case. Instead the call-id value was
	  included for every RINGING Notify message, which caused a
	  regression for people who used other methods for call pickup.

	  Fix MWI notification transmission problems over SIP. MWI updates
	  were not being sent if no messages were found in the event cache.
	  This was corrected since a phone may need to clear its MWI status
	  configured previously from another mailbox. Upon module or sip
	  reload, MWI updates could not be sent due to the sipsock socket
	  not being set early enough in reload_config. The code handling
	  the descriptor assignment and such has simply been moved before
	  the call to build_peer. Issuing a sip reload cleared the IP
	  address of the peer, but skipped checking the database for
	  registration information. The database is now checked both for
	  sip reload and actually reloading the module. If a transmission
	  occurs before the do_monitor thread has started, do not attempt
	  to send a signal to it. (closes issue #17398) Reported by: ip-rob

	  First off, these options weren't actually doing anything. By the
	  time the options were parsed, the peer and dialog containers had
	  already been allocated with their default values. Second, hash
	  table size is something that doesn't really make sense to change
	  in a config file. If a user is that interested in changing the
	  hashtable size, he can modify the source itself. I have removed
	  the parsing of the hash_peer, hash_user, and hash_dialog options.
	  I have removed the hash_user_size variable altogether since it is
	  not used at all. I also changed hash_peer_size and
	  hash_dialog_size to be constant, and have changed the symbols to
	  be in all caps as constants typically are. I have also removed
	  the entire section in sip.conf.sample regarding configurable
	  hashtable sizes. ........ (merge to 1.6.2 inspired by issue

	  Fix some issues related to dynamic feature groups in
	  features.conf. The bridge handling code did not properly consider
	  feature groups when setting parameters that would affect whether
	  or not a native bridge would be attempted. If DYNAMIC_FEATURES
	  only include a feature group, a native bridge would occur that
	  may prevent features from working. Fix a bug in verbose output
	  that would show the key mapping as empty if it was using the
	  default mapping and not a custom mapping in the feature group.
	  Add feature groups to the output of "features show". Adjust the
	  feature execution logic to match that of the logic when executing
	  a feature that was not configured through a feature group. Update
	  features.conf.sample to show that an '=' is still required if
	  using the default key mapping from [applicationmap]. Finally,
	  clean up a little bit of formatting to better coform to coding
	  guidelines while in the area. (closes issue #17589) Reported by:

	  | 9 lines Add option to not do a call forward on 482 Loop
	  Detected Asterisk has always set up a forwarded call when
	  receiving a 482 Loop Detected. This prevents handling the call
	  failure by just continuing on in the dialplan. Since this would
	  be a change in behavior, the new option to disable this behavior
	  is forwardloopdetected which defaults to 'yes'. Review:

	  are a number of problems with Asterisk trying to cleanly shut

	  procedure to be more explicit to ensure that the thread exits
	  from a point where it is not holding a lock. While testing that,
	  I encountered various crashes due to the order of operations in
	  unload_module() being problematic. I reordered some things there,

	* apps/app_queue.c: Fix memory hogging behavior of app_queue. From
	  reviewboard: This review request is for the patch on issue 17081.
	  A user reported that he saw increasing numbers of allocations
	  stemming from app_queue.c when he would run the "queue show" CLI
	  command. The user reported that he was using approximately 40
	  realtime queues and as he ran the CLI command more and more, the
	  memory usage would shoot up. As it turns out, there was a memory
	  leak and a separate usage of memory that, while not really a
	  leak, was very irresponsible. Both memory problems can be
	  attributed to the function init_queue(). When the "queue show"
	  command is run, all realtime queues have the init_queue()
	  function called on the in-memory queue. The idea is to place the
	  queue in its default state and then overwrite options specified
	  in the realtime backend as we read them. The first problem, the
	  memory leak, had to do with the fact that the string field for
	  the name of the first periodic announcement file was being
	  re-created every time init_queue was called. This patch corrects
	  the behavior by only calling ast_str_create if the memory has not
	  already been allocated. The other problem is a bit more
	  complicated. The majority of the strings in the call_queue
	  structure were changed to use the ast_string_fields API for 1.6.0
	  and beyond. init_queue resets all string fields on the queue to
	  their default values. Then, later in the realtime queue loading
	  process, these string fields are set to their configured values.
	  For those unfamiliar with string fields, frequent resizing of a
	  string like this is not what the string fields API is designed
	  for. The result of this constant resizing is that as the queue
	  gets loaded, eventually space for the string runs out and so a
	  new memory pool, at twice the size of the previously allocated
	  one, is created for the string fields. The reporter of issue
	  17081 wrote a script that ran the "queue show" CLI command 2100
	  times. By the end, each of his 40 queues was taking about a
	  megabyte of memory apiece just for their string fields. My fix
	  for this problem is to revert the call_queue structure from using
	  string fields. In my patch here, I have moved the queue back to
	  using fixed-sized buffers. I ran the script provided by the
	  reporter of 17081 and determined that I no longer saw the
	  steadily-increasing memory usage that I had seen before applying
	  the patch. (closes issue #17081) Reported by: wliegel Patches:

	  2010) | 32 lines Allow ast_safe_sleep to defer specific frames
	  until after the sleep has concluded. From reviewboard Background:
	  A Digium customer discovered a somewhat odd bug. The setup is
	  that parties A and B are bridged, and party A places party B on
	  hold. While party B is listening to hold music, he mashes a bunch
	  of DTMF. Party A takes party B off hold while this is happening,
	  but party B continues to hear hold music. I could reproduce this
	  about 1 in 5 times. The issue: When DTMF features are enabled and
	  a user presses keys, the channel that the DTMF is streamed to is
	  placed in an ast_safe_sleep for 100 ms, the duration of the
	  emulated tone. If an AST_CONTROL_UNHOLD frame is read from the
	  channel during the sleep, the frame is dropped. Thus the unhold
	  indication is never made to the channel that was originally
	  placed on hold. The fix: Originally, I discussed with Kevin
	  possible ways of fixing the specific problem reported. However,
	  we determined that the same type of problem could happen in other
	  situations where ast_safe_sleep() is used. Using autoservice as a
	  model, I modified ast_safe_sleep_conditional() to defer specific
	  frame types so they can be re-queued once the sleep has finished.
	  I made a common function for determining if a frame should be
	  deferred so that there are not two identical switch blocks to
	  maintain. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/674/

	  lines Fix transcode_via_sln option with SIP calls and improve PLC
	  usage. From reviewboard: The problem here is a bit complex, so
	  try to bear with me... It was noticed by a Digium customer that
	  generic PLC (as configured in codecs.conf) did not appear to
	  actually be having any sort of benefit when packet loss was
	  introduced on an RTP stream. I reproduced this issue myself by
	  streaming a file across an RTP stream and dropping approx. 5% of
	  the RTP packets. I saw no real difference between when PLC was
	  enabled or disabled when using wireshark to analyze the RTP
	  streams. After analyzing what was going on, it became clear that
	  one of the problems faced was that when running my tests, the
	  translation paths were being set up in such a way that PLC could
	  not possibly work as expected. To illustrate, if packets are lost
	  on channel A's read stream, then we expect that PLC will be
	  applied to channel B's write stream. The problem is that generic
	  PLC can only be done when there is a translation path that moves
	  from some codec to SLINEAR. When I would run my tests, I found
	  that every single time, read and write translation paths would be
	  set up on channel A instead of channel B. There appeared to be no
	  real way to predict which channel the translation paths would be
	  set up on. This is where Kevin swooped in to let me know about
	  the transcode_via_sln option in asterisk.conf. It is supposed to
	  work by placing a read translation path on both channels from the
	  channel's rawreadformat to SLINEAR. It also will place a write
	  translation path on both channels from SLINEAR to the channel's
	  rawwriteformat. Using this option allows one to predictably set
	  up translation paths on all channels. There are two problems with
	  this, though. First and foremost, the transcode_via_sln option
	  did not appear to be working properly when I was placing a SIP
	  call between two endpoints which did not share any common
	  formats. Second, even if this option were to work, for PLC to be
	  applied, there had to be a write translation path that would go
	  from some format to SLINEAR. It would not work properly if the
	  starting format of translation was SLINEAR. The one-line change
	  presented in this review request in chan_sip.c fixed the first
	  issue for me. The problem was that in sip_request_call, the
	  jointcapability of the outbound channel was being set to the
	  format passed to sip_request_call. This is nativeformats of the
	  inbound channel. Because of this, when
	  ast_channel_make_compatible was called by app_dial, both channels
	  already had compatibly read and write formats. Thus, no
	  translation path was set up at the time. My change is to set the
	  jointcapability of the sip_pvt created during sip_request_call to
	  the intersection of the inbound channel's nativeformats and the
	  configured peer capability that we determined during the earlier
	  call to create_addr. Doing this got the translation paths set up
	  as expected when using transcode_via_sln. The changes presented
	  in channel.c fixed the second issue for me. First and foremost,
	  when Asterisk is started, we'll read codecs.conf to see the value
	  of the genericplc option. If this option is set, and ast_write is
	  called for a frame with no data, then we will attempt to fill in
	  the missing samples for the frame. The implementation uses a
	  channel datastore for maintaining the PLC state and for creating
	  a buffer to store PLC samples in. Even when we receive a frame
	  with data, we'll call plc_rx so that the PLC state will have
	  knowledge of the previous voice frame, which it can use as a
	  basis for when it comes time to actually do a PLC fill-in. So,
	  reviewers, now I ask for your help. First off, there's the one
	  line change in chan_sip that I have put in. Is it right? By my
	  logic it seems correct, but I'm sure someone can tell me why it
	  is not going to work. This is probably the change I'm least
	  concerned about, though. What concerns me much more is the set of
	  changes in channel.c. First off, am I even doing it right? When I
	  run tests, I can clearly see that when PLC is activated, I see a
	  significant increase in RTP traffic where I would expect it to
	  be. However, in my humble opinion, the audio sounds kind of
	  crappy whenever the PLC fill-in is done. It sounds worse to me
	  than when no PLC is used at all. I need someone to review the
	  logic I have used to be sure that I'm not misusing anything. As
	  far as I can see my pointer arithmetic is correct, and my use of
	  AST_FRIENDLY_OFFSET should be correct as well, but I'm sure
	  someone can point out somewhere where I've done something
	  incorrectly. As I was writing this review request up, I decided
	  to give the code a test run under valgrind, and I find that for
	  some reason, calls to plc_rx are causing some invalid reads.
	  Apparently I'm reading past the end of a buffer somehow. I'll
	  have to dig around a bit to see why that is the case. If it's
	  obvious to someone reviewing, speak up! Finally, I have one other
	  proposal that is not reflected in my code review. Since without
	  transcode_via_sln set, one cannot predict or control where a
	  translation path will be up, it seems to me that the current
	  practice of using PLC only when transcoding to SLINEAR is not
	  useful. I recommend that once it has been determined that the
	  method used in this code review is correct and works as expected,
	  then the code in translate.c that invokes PLC should be removed.

	  Fix handling of removing nodes from the middle of a heap. This
	  bug surfaced in 1.6.2 and does not affect code in any other
	  released version of Asterisk. It manifested itself as SIP qualify
	  not happening when it should, causing peers to go unreachable.
	  This was debugged down to scheduler entries sometimes not getting
	  executed when they were supposed to, which was in turn caused by
	  an error in the heap code. The problem only sometimes occurs, and
	  it is due to the logic for removing an entry in the heap from an
	  arbitrary location (not just popping off the top). The scheduler
	  performs this operation frequently when entries are removed
	  before they run (when ast_sched_del() is used). In a normal pop
	  off of the top of the heap, a node is taken off the bottom,
	  placed at the top, and then bubbled down until the max heap
	  property is restored (see max_heapify()). This same logic was
	  used for removing an arbitrary node from the middle of the heap.
	  Unfortunately, that logic is full of fail. This patch fixes that
	  by fully restoring the max heap property when a node is thrown
	  into the middle of the heap. Instead of just pushing it down as
	  appropriate, it first pushes it up as high as it will go, and
	  _then_ pushes it down. Lastly, fix a minor problem in
	  ast_heap_verify(), which is only used for debugging. If a parent
	  and child node have the same value, that is not an error. The
	  only error is if a parent's value is less than its children. A
	  huge thanks goes out to cappucinoking for debugging this down to
	  the scheduler, and then producing an ast_heap test case that
	  demonstrated the breakage. That made it very easy for me to focus
	  on the heap logic and produce a fix. Open source projects are
	  awesome. (closes issue #16936) Reported by: ib2 Tested by:

	  Mar 2010) | 49 lines Improve handling of T.38 re-INVITEs that
	  arrive before a T.38-capable application is executing on a
	  channel. This patch addresses an issue found during working with
	  end-users using res_fax. If an incoming call is answered in the
	  dialplan, or jumps to the 'fax' extension due to reception of a
	  CNG tone (with faxdetect enabled), and then the remote endpoint
	  sends a T.38 re-INVITE, it is possible for the channel's T.38
	  state to be 'T38_STATE_NEGOTIATING' when the application starts
	  up. Unfortunately, even if the application wants to use T.38, it
	  can't respond to the peer's negotiation request, because the
	  AST_CONTROL_T38_PARAMETERS control frame that chan_sip sent
	  originally has been lost, and the application needs the content
	  of that frame to be able to formulate a reply. This patch adds a
	  new 'request' type to AST_CONTROL_T38_PARAMETERS,
	  AST_T38_REQUEST_PARMS. If the application sends this request,
	  chan_sip will re-send the original control frame (with
	  AST_T38_REQUEST_NEGOTIATE as the request type), and the
	  application can respond as normal. If this occurs within the five
	  second timeout in chan_sip, the automatic cancellation of the
	  peer reinvite will be stopped, and the application will 'own' the
	  negotiation process from that point onwards. This also improves
	  the code path in chan_sip to allow sip_indicate(), when called
	  for AST_CONTROL_T38_PARAMETERS, to be able to return a non-zero
	  response, which should have been in place before since the
	  control frame *can* fail to be processed properly. It also
	  modifies ast_indicate() to return whatever result the channel
	  driver returned for this control frame, rather than converting
	  all non-zero results into '-1'. Finally, the new request type
	  intentionally returns a positive value, so that an application
	  that sends AST_T38_REQUEST_PARMS can know for certain whether the
	  channel driver accepted it and will be replying with a control
	  frame of its own, or whether it was ignored (if the
	  sip_indicate()/ast_indicate() path had properly supported failure
	  responses before, this would not be necessary). This patch also
	  modifies res_fax to take advantage of the new request. In
	  addition, this patch makes sip_t38_abort() actually lock the
	  private structure before doing its work... bad programmer, no
	  donut. This patch also enhances chan_sip's 'faxdetect' support to
	  allow triggering on T.38 re-INVITEs received as well as CNG tone
	  detection. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/556/

	  accessing channel data without the channel locked. In
	  res_musiconhold.c, there are several places where a channel's
	  stream's existence is checked prior to calling ast_closestream on
	  it. The issue here is that in several cases, the channel was not
	  locked while checking the stream. The result was that if two
	  threads checked the state of the channel's stream at
	  approximately the same time, then there could be a situation
	  where both threads attempt to call ast_closestream on the
	  channel's stream. The result here is that the refcount for the
	  stream would go below 0, resulting in a crash. I have added
	  proper channel locking to res_musiconhold.c to ensure that we do
	  not try to check chan->stream without the channel locked. A
	  Digium customer has been using this patch for several weeks and
	  has not had any crashes since applying the patch. ABE-2147

	  | 33 lines resolves deadlocks in chan_local Issue_1. In the
	  local_hangup() 3 locks must be held at the same time... pvt,
	  pvt->chan, and pvt->owner. Proper deadlock avoidance is done when
	  the channel to hangup is the outbound chan_local channel, but
	  when it is not the outbound channel we have an issue... We
	  attempt to do deadlock avoidance only on the tech pvt, when both
	  the tech pvt and the pvt->owner are locked coming into that loop.
	  By never giving up the pvt->owner channel deadlock avoidance is
	  not entirely possible. This patch resolves that by doing deadlock
	  avoidance on both the pvt->owner and the pvt when trying to get
	  the pvt->chan lock. Issue_2. ast_prod() is used in
	  ast_activate_generator() to queue a frame on the channel and make
	  the channel's read function get called. This function is used in
	  ast_activate_generator() while the channel is locked, which
	  mean's the channel will have a lock both from the generator code
	  and the frame_queue code by the time it gets to chan_local.c's
	  local_queue_frame code... local_queue_frame contains some of the
	  same crazy deadlock avoidance that local_hangup requires, and
	  this recursive lock prevents that deadlock avoidance from
	  happening correctly. This patch removes ast_prod() from the
	  channel lock so only one lock is held during the
	  local_queue_frame function. (closes issue #17185) Reported by:

	  Add ast_event subscription unit test and fix some ast_event API
	  bugs. This patch introduces another test in test_event.c that
	  exercises most of the subscription related ast_event API calls. I
	  made some minor additions to the existing event allocation test
	  to increase API coverage by the test code. Finally, I made a list
	  in a comment of API calls not yet touched by the test module as a
	  to-do list for future test development. During the development of
	  this test code, I discovered a number of bugs in the event API.
	  1) subscriptions to AST_EVENT_ALL were not handled appropriately
	  in a couple of different places. The API allows a subscription to
	  all event types, but with IE parameters, just as if it was a
	  subscription to a specific event type. However, the parameters
	  were being ignored. This affected ast_event_check_subscriber()
	  and event distribution to subscribers. 2) Some of the logic in
	  ast_event_check_subscriber() for checking subscriptions against
	  query parameters was wrong. Review:

	  | 21 lines Make the mixmonitor thread process audio frames faster
	  Mantis issue 17078 reports MixMonitor recordings have shorter
	  durations than the call duration. This was because the mixmonitor
	  thread was not processing frames from the audiohook fast enough.
	  The mixmonitor thread would slowly fall behind the most recent
	  audio frame and when the channel hangs up, the mixmonitor thread
	  would exit without processing the same number of frames as the
	  channel; leaving the mixmonitor recording shorter than actual
	  call duration. This revision fixes this issue by moving the
	  ast_audiohook_trigger_wait() and the subsequent audiohook.status
	  check into the block where the ast_audiohook_read_frame()
	  function returns NULL. (closes issue #17078) Reported by:

	  that broken behavior. Also while fixing this bug I discovered
	  that passing an empty EventMasks parameter would also result in
	  no response being returned, this has been fixed as well while
	  being preserved when the broken behavior is requested. (closes

	  2010) | 44 lines Several fixes regarding RFC2833 DTMF detection.
	  Here is a copy and paste of the details from my request on
	  reviewboard that dealt with these changes: Fix 1. The first
	  change in place is to fix Mantis issue 15811, which deals with a
	  situation where Asterisk will incorrectly interpret out of order
	  RFC2833 frames as duplicate DTMF digits. For instance, we would
	  receive a sequence like: seqno 1: DTMF 1 seqno 2: DTMF 1 seqno 3:
	  DTMF 1 seqno 4: DTMF 1 seqno 6: DTMF 1 (end) seqno 5: DTMF 1
	  seqno 7: DTMF 1 (end) seqno 8: DTMF 1 (end) Prior to this patch
	  when we received the frame with seqno 5, we would interpret this
	  as a new DTMF 1. With this patch, we will check the seqno of the
	  incoming digit and not process the frame if the seqno is lower
	  than the last recorded seqno. Note that we do not record the
	  seqno of the dropped DTMF frame for future processing. While the
	  above situation is what was designed to be fixed, the patch is
	  written in such a way that the following would also be fixed too:
	  seqno 9: DTMF 1 seqno 10: DTMF 1 (end) seqno 11: DTMF 1 (end)
	  seqno 13: DTMF 2 seqno 12: DTMF 1 (end) seqno 14: DTMF 2 seqno
	  15: DTMF 2 (end) seqno 16: DTMF 2 (end) seqno 17: DTMF 2 (end) In
	  this second situation, the beginning of the DTMF 2 arrives before
	  the final end frame of the DTMF 1. With the patch, seqno 12 is no
	  processed and thus we properly interpret the DTMF. Fix 2. The
	  second change in place is to fix an issue like the following:
	  seqno 1: DTMF 1 seqno 2: DTMF 1 seqno 3: DTMF 1 (end) *packet
	  lost* seqno 4: DTMF 1 (end) *packet lost* seqno 5: DTMF 1 (end)
	  *packet lost* seqno 6: DTMF 2 When we receive seqno 6, we had
	  code in place that was supposed to properly end the previously
	  unended DTMF 1. The problem was that the code was essentially a
	  no-op. The code would set up an end frame for the DTMF 1 but
	  would immediately overwrite the frame with the begin for DTMF 2.
	  I changed process_dtmf_rfc2833() so that instead of returning a
	  single frame, it is given as an output parameter a list of
	  frames. Each frame that needs to be returned is appended to this
	  list. Fix 3. The final change is a minor one where an
	  AST_CONTROL_SRCCHANGE frame could get lost. If we process a cisco
	  DTMF or an RFC 3389 frame and no frame was returned, then we
	  would return &ast_null_frame. The problem is that earlier in the
	  function, we may have generated an AST_CONTROL_SRCCHANGE frame
	  and put it in the list of frames we wish to return. This frame
	  would be lost in such a case. The patch fixes this problem

	  Only change the RTP ssrc when we see that it has changed This
	  change basically reverts the change reviewed in
	  https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/374/ and instead limits the
	  updating of the RTP synchronization source to only those times
	  when we detect that the other side of the conversation has
	  changed the ssrc. The problem is that SRCUPDATE control frames
	  are sent many times where we don't want a new ssrc, including
	  whenever Asterisk has to send DTMF in a normal bridge. This is
	  also not the first time that this mistake has been made. The
	  initial implementation of the ast_rtp_new_source function also
	  changed the ssrc--and then it was removed because of this same
	  issue. Then, we put it back in again to fix a different issue.
	  This patch attempts to only change the ssrc when we see that the
	  other side of the conversation has changed the ssrc. It also
	  renames some functions to make their purpose more clear. Review:

	  tests (battery loss) and polarity reversal. The polarity reversal

	  this the event DAHDI_EVENT_NOALARM is ignored so that the alarm

	  19 Feb 2010) | 49 lines Make chan_misdn DTMF processing
	  consistent with other channel technologies. The processing of
	  DTMF tones on the receiving side of an ISDN channel is
	  inconsistent with the way it is handled in other channels,
	  especially DAHDI analog. This causes DTMF tones sent from an ISDN
	  phone to be doubled at the connected party. We are using the
	  following 2 options of misdn.conf 1) astdtmf=yes 2) senddtmf=yes
	  Option one is necessary because the asterisk DSP DTMF detection
	  is better than mISDN's internal DSP. Not as many false positives.
	  Option two is necessary to transmit DTMF tones end to end when
	  mISDN channels are connected to SIP channels with out of band
	  DTMF for example. The symptom is that DTMF tones sent by an ISDN
	  phone are doubled on the way through asterisk when two mISDN
	  channels are connected with a Local channel in between or if it
	  is bridged to an analog channel. The doubling of DTMF tones is
	  because DTMF is passed inband to asterisk by the mISDN channel
	  and passed out of band once again after the release of the DTMF
	  tone. Passing it inband is wrong. Neither an analog channel nor
	  SIP channel passes DTMF inband if configured to inband DTMF.
	  Analog and SIP channels filter out the DTMF tones because they
	  use the voice frames returned by ast_dsp_process. But chan_misdn
	  passes the unfiltered input voice frames instead. To overcome one
	  aspect of the problem, the doubling of DTMF tones when two mISDN
	  channels are directly bridged, someone made an 'optimization',
	  where in that case the DTMF tone passed out-of-band to the peer
	  channel is not translated to an inband tone at the transmit side.
	  This optimization is bad because it does not work in general. For
	  example, analog channels or mISDN channels when bridged through
	  an intermediary local channel will generate DTMF tones from
	  out-of-band information. Also, of course, it must not be done
	  when there is no inband DTMF available. This patch fixes the
	  issue. Now chan_misdn will filter the received inband DTMF signal
	  the same as other channel types. Another change included: No need
	  to build an extra translation path because ast_process_dsp does
	  it if required. Patches: misdn-dtmf.patch JIRA ABE-2080

	  lines If the peer record is from realtime, it could be set to 0,
	  due to MySQL not representing NULL well in integer columns. NULL
	  means the value is not specified for the column, which normally
	  means the driver uses whatever is the default value. However, on
	  MySQL, placing a NULL in either a float or integer column results
	  in a retrieval of the 0 value. Hence, users get an errant error
	  on load. This patch suppresses that error and makes the value as
	  if it was not there. Note that this cannot be done in the
	  realtime driver, because the lack of difference between NULL and
	  0 can only be intepreted correctly by the driver itself. If we
	  did it in the realtime driver, then it would be effectively
	  impossible to set any realtime field to 0, because it would act
	  as if the field were unspecified and possibly take on a different
	  value. (closes issue #16683) Reported by: wdoekes ........

	  order to limit the size of the ast_str to its current allocated
	  size. The problem was that the max_len parameter in all cases was
	  a size_t, which is unsigned. Thus a -1 was interpreted as
	  UINT_MAX instead of -1. Changing the max_len parameter to be
	  ssize_t fixed this issue. 2. Once issue 1 was fixed, there was an
	  off-by-one error in the case where we attempted to write a string
	  larger than the current allotted size to a string when -1 was

	  fixes sample rate conversion issue with Monitor application When
	  using ast_seekstream with the read/write streams of a monitor,
	  the number of samples we are seeking must be of the same rate as
	  the stream or the jump calculation will be incorrect. This patch
	  adds logic to correctly convert the number of samples to jump to
	  the sample rate the read/write stream is using. For example, if
	  the call is G722 (16khz) and the read/write stream is recording a
	  8khz wav, seeking 320 samples of 16khz audio is not the same as
	  seeking 320 samples of 8khz audio when performing the
	  ast_seekstream on the stream. ABE-2044 ........

	  module reload if multiple extension configs are present, such as
	  both extensions.conf and extensions.ael, watchers for one

	  config. This happens because hint watchers are only preserved for
	  the current config being merged. The old context list is
	  destroyed after the merging takes place, meaning any watchers
	  that were not perserved will be removed. Now all hints are
	  preserved during merging regardless of what config file is being

	  | 48 lines Correct CDR dispositions for BUSY/FAILED This patch is
	  simple in that it reorders the disposition defines so that the
	  fix for issue 12946 works properly (the default CDR disposition
	  was changed to AST_CDR_NOANSWER). Also, the
	  AST_CDR_FLAG_ORIGINATED flag was set in ast_call to ensure all
	  CDR records are written. The side effects of CDR changes are
	  scary, so I'm documenting the test cases performed to attempt to
	  catch any regressions. The following tests were all performed
	  using 1.4 rev 195881 vs head (235571) + patch: A calls B C calls
	  B (busy) Hangup C Hangup A (Both SIP and features) A calls B A

	  attended transfers to C Hangup C A calls B A attended transfers
	  to C (SIP) C blind transfers to A (features) Hangup A All of the
	  test scenario CDRs matched. The following tests were performed
	  just with the patch to ensure proper operation (with

	  | 16 lines Set a module load priority for format modules. A
	  recent change to app_voicemail made it such that the module now
	  assumes that all format modules are available while processing
	  voicemail configuration. However, when autoloading modules, it
	  was possible that app_voicemail was loaded before the format
	  modules. Since format modules don't depend on anything, set a
	  module load priority on them to ensure that they get loaded first
	  when autoloading. This fix applies to trunk, 1.6.1, and 1.6.2.
	  The fix for 1.4 and 1.6.0 will require a different approach since
	  the module load priority functionality is not present in the
	  module API. (issue #16412) Reported by: jiddings ........

	  lines Fix multiple issues with musiconhold, which led to classes
	  not getting destroyed properly. * Classes are now tracked past
	  removal from the core container, and module removal is actively
	  prevented until all references are freed. * A hanging reference
	  stored in the channel has been removed. This could have caused a
	  mismatch and the music state not properly cleared, if two or more
	  reloads occurred between MOH being stopped and MOH being
	  restarted. * In certain circumstances, duplicate classes were
	  possible. * A race existed at reload time between a process being
	  killed and the thread responsible for reading from the related
	  pipe respawning that process. * Several reference counts have
	  also been corrected. At least one could have caused deleted
	  classes to stick around forever, consuming resources. This
	  originally manifested as MOH external processes that were not
	  killed at reload time. (closes issue #16279, closes issue #16207)

	  lines Another round of UDPTL stack fixes/improvements: 1) Allow
	  users of UDPTL stack to associate a character-string tag with a
	  UDPTL session, so that log/error/debug messages generated by the
	  UDPTL stack can be 'connected' to the endpoint that caused them
	  to be generated. 2) Improve comments (and process) of calculating
	  the far end's maximum IFP size when redundancy mode is in use for
	  error correction. 3) When an IFP larger than the calculated 'far
	  max IFP' size is presented for writing, truncate it rather than
	  putting in the buffer and allowing the buffer to overflow; this
	  will cause the ends to retrain to a lower bit rate that produces
	  IFPs of an appropriate size if possible, and if not possible, the
	  FAX transfer will fail completely. In these cases, it is due to
	  the one endpoint supplying a T38FaxMaxDatagram value that is
	  improperly calculated and is too low to be of use; we have
	  configuration options available to override this behavior. 4)
	  Eliminate use of T38FaxMaxDatagram value in udptl.conf; it is no
	  longer needed. ........

	* channels/chan_sip.c: SIP channel name uniqueness SIP channel
	  names were supposed to be unique by way of a name suffix derived
	  from the pointer to the channel's private data. Uniqueness was
	  preserved on 32-bit systems, but not on 64-bit systems. This
	  patch, as suggested by kpfleming, replaces this suffix with a
	  simple incremented unsigned int. (closes issue #15152) Reported

	  SIP TCP/TLS: move client connection setup/write into tcp helper
	  thread, various related locking/memory fixes. What this patch
	  fixes 1.Moves sip TCP/TLS connection setup into the TCP helper
	  thread: Connection setup takes awhile and before this it was
	  being done while holding the monitor lock. 2.Moves TCP/TLS
	  writing to the TCP helper thread: Through the use of a packet
	  queue and an alert pipe, the TCP helper thread can now be woken
	  up to write data as well as read data. 3.Locking error: sip_xmit
	  returned an XMIT_ERROR without giving up the tcptls_session lock.
	  This lock has been completely removed from sip_xmit and placed in
	  the new sip_tcptls_write() function. 4.Memory leak: When creating
	  a tcptls_client the tls_cfg was alloced but never freed unless
	  the tcptls_session failed to start. Now the session_args for a
	  sip client are an ao2 object which frees the tls_cfg on
	  destruction. 5.Pointer to stack variable: During
	  sip_prepare_socket the creation of a client's
	  ast_tcptls_session_args was done on the stack and stored as a
	  pointer in the newly created tcptls_session. Depending on the
	  events that followed, there was a slight possibility that pointer
	  could have been accessed after the stack returned. Given the new
	  changes, it is always accessed after the stack returns which is
	  why I found it. Notable code changes 1.I broke tcptls.c's
	  ast_tcptls_client_start() function into two functions. One for
	  creating and allocating the new tcptls_session, and a separate
	  one for starting and handling the new connection. This allowed me
	  to create the tcptls_session, launch the helper thread, and then
	  establish the connection within the helper thread. 2.Writes to a
	  tcptls_session are now done within the helper thread. This is
	  done by using an alert pipe to wake up the thread if new data
	  needs to be sent. The thread's sip_threadinfo object contains the
	  alert pipe as well as the packet queue. 3.Since the threadinfo
	  object contains the alert pipe, it must now be accessed outside
	  of the helper thread for every write (queuing of a packet). For
	  easy lookup, I moved the threadinfo objects from a linked list to
	  an ao2_container. (closes issue #13136) Reported by: pabelanger

	  | 13 lines IAX2: VNAK loop caused by signaling frames with no
	  destination call number It is possible for the PBX thread to
	  queue up signaling frames before a destination call number is
	  received. This can result in signaling frames being sent out with
	  no destination call number. Since recent versions of Asterisk
	  require accurate destination callnumbers for all Full Frames,
	  this can cause a VNAK loop to occur. To resolve this no signaling
	  frames are sent until a destination callnumber is received, and
	  destination call numbers are now only required for iax_pvt
	  matching when the frame is an ACK. Review:

	  | 44 lines Make filestream frame handling safer by isolating
	  frames before returning them. This patch is related to a number
	  of issues on the bug tracker that show crashes related to freeing
	  frames that came from a filestream. A number of fixes have been
	  made over time while trying to figure out these problems, but
	  there re still people seeing the crash. (Note that some of these
	  bug reports include information about other problems. I am
	  specifically addressing the filestream frame crash here.) I'm
	  still not clear on what the exact problem is. However, what is
	  _very_ clear is that we have seen quite a few problems over time
	  related to unexpected behavior when we try to use embedded frames
	  as an optimization. In some cases, this optimization doesn't
	  really provide much due to improvements made in other areas. In
	  this case, the patch modifies filestream handling such that the
	  embedded frame will not be returned. ast_frisolate() is used to
	  ensure that we end up with a completely mallocd frame. In
	  reality, though, we will not actually have to malloc every time.
	  For filestreams, the frame will almost always be allocated and
	  freed in the same thread. That means that the thread local frame
	  cache will be used. So, going this route doesn't hurt. With this
	  patch in place, some people have reported success in not seeing
	  the crash anymore. (SWP-150) (AST-208) (ABE-1834) (issue #15609)

	  instead of a macro, with a name that fits our naming policy;
	  also, it is now necessary to call ao2_iterator_destroy() on any
	  iterator that has been created. Currently this only releases the
	  reference to the container being iterated, but in the future this
	  could also release other resources used by the iterator, if the

	  supportable via configuration option. Many T.38 endpoints
	  incorrectly send the maximum IFP frame size they can accept as
	  the T38FaxMaxDatagram value in their SDP, when in fact this value
	  is supposed to be the maximum UDPTL payload size (datagram size)
	  they can accept. If the value they supply is small enough (a
	  commonly supplied value is '72'), T.38 UDPTL transmissions will
	  likely fail completely because the UDPTL packets will not have
	  enough room for a primary IFP frame and the redundancy used for
	  error correction. If this occurs, the Asterisk UDPTL stack will
	  emit log messages warning that data loss may occur, and that the
	  value may need to be overridden. This patch extends the
	  't38pt_udptl' configuration option in sip.conf to allow the
	  administrator to override the value supplied by the remote
	  endpoint and supply a value that allows T.38 FAX transmissions to
	  be successful with that endpoint. In addition, in any SIP call
	  where the override takes effect, a debug message will be printed
	  to that effect. This patch also removes the T38FaxMaxDatagram
	  configuration option from udptl.conf.sample, since it has not
	  actually had any effect for a number of releases. In addition,
	  this patch cleans up the T.38 documentation in sip.conf.sample
	  (which incorrectly documented that T.38 support was passthrough
	  only). (issue #15586) Reported by: globalnetinc ........

	  The original issue reported to Digium support detailed the
	  following situation: ITSP <-> Asterisk 1.4.26.2 <-> SIP-based
	  Application Server Call comes in fromITSP, Asterisk dials the app
	  server which sends a re-invite back toAsterisk--not to negotiate
	  to send media directly to the ITSP, but to indicatethat it's
	  changing the stream it's sending to Asterisk. The app
	  servergenerates a new SSRC, sequence numbers, timestamps, and
	  sets the marker bit on the new stream. Asterisk passes through
	  the teimstamp of the new stream, butdoes not reset the SSRC,
	  sequence numbers, or set the marker bit. When the timestamp on
	  the new stream is older than the timestamp on the originalstream,
	  the ITSP (which doesn't know there has been any change) discards
	  the newframes because it thinks they are too old. This patch
	  addresses this by changing the SSRC on a stream update unless
	  constantssrc=true is set in sip.conf. Review:

	  when hanging up a channel by removing the channel from the
	  channel list before begining channel tear down. This fix may
	  potentially cause problems with CDR backends that access the
	  channel a CDR is associated with via the channel list. This fix
	  makes the channel unavabile at the time when the CDR backend is
	  invoked. This has been documented in include/asterisk/cdr.h.

	  | 13 lines Fixes CID pattern matching behavior to mirror that of
	  extension pattern matching. Pattern matching for extensions uses
	  a type of scoring system, giving values for specificity to each
	  character in the pattern. Unfortunately, this is done character
	  by character, in order. This does lead to some less specific
	  patterns being first in line for matching, but it will usually
	  get the job done. This patch merely brings CID matching to the
	  same level as extension matching. This patch does not attempt to
	  tackle the problem shared by extension matching. (closes issue

	  | 22 lines IAX2 encryption regression The IAX2 Call Token
	  security patch inadvertently broke the use of encryption due to
	  the reorganization of code in the socket_process() function. When
	  encryption is used, an incoming full frame must first be
	  decrypted before the information elements can be parsed. The
	  security release mistakenly moved IE parsing before decryption in
	  order to process the new Call Token IE. To resolve this,
	  decryption of full frames is once again done before looking into
	  the frame. This involves searching for an existing callno,
	  checking the pvt to see if encryption is turned on, and
	  decrypting the packet before the internal fields of the full
	  frame are accessed. (closes issue #15834) Reported by: karesmakro

	  lines Make apps send PROGRESS control frame for early media and
	  fix too early media issue in SIP The issue at hand is that some
	  legacy (dying) PBX systems send empty media frames on PRI links
	  *before* any call progress. The SIP channel receives these frames
	  and by default signals 183 Session progress and starts sending
	  media. This will cause phones to play silence and ignore the
	  later 180 ringing message. A bad user experience. The fix is
	  twofold: - We discovered that asterisk apps that support early
	  media ("noanswer") did not send any PROGRESS frame to indicate
	  early media. Fixed. - We introduce a setting in chan_sip so that
	  users can disable any relay of media frames before the outbound
	  channel actually indicates any sort of call progress. In 1.4,
	  1.6.0 and 1.6.1, this will be disabled for backward
	  compatibility. In later versions of Asterisk, this will be
	  enabled. We don't assume that it will change your Asterisk phone
	  experience - only for the better. We encourage third-party
	  application developers to make sure that if they have
	  applications that wants to send early media, add a PROGRESS
	  control frame transmission to make sure that all channel drivers
	  actually will start sending early media. This has not been the
	  default in Asterisk previous to this patch, so if you got
	  inspiration from our code, you need to update accordingly. Sorry
	  for the trouble and thanks for your support. This code has been
	  running for a few months in a large scale installation (over 250
	  servers with PRI and/or BRI links to old PBX systems). That's no
	  proof that this is an excellent patch, but, well, it's tested :-)

	  Do not treat every SIP peer as if they were configured with
	  insecure=port. There was a problem in the function responsible
	  for doing peer matching by IP address and port number such that
	  during the second pass for checking for a peer configured with
	  insecure=port, it would end up treating every peer as if it had
	  been configured that way. These changes fix the logic in the peer
	  IP and port comparison callback to handle insecure=port checking
	  properly. This problem was introduced when SIP peers were
	  converted to astobj2. Many thanks to dvossel for noticing this
	  while working on another peer matching issue. ........

	  SIP support for keep-alive event keep-alive events are used by
	  Sipura/Linksys for NAT keepalive. There currently don't appear to
	  be any problems with NAT, but everytime a keep-alive event is
	  received, Asterisk responds with a "489 Bad event". This error
	  may indicate to a user that NAT problems exist just because this
	  even is not supported. Now, rather than respond with an error,
	  the packet is consumed and a "200 ok" is sent just to indicate we
	  received the packet. (issue #15084) Patches:

	  not being handled at all, and the original frame passed into it
	  did not contain the mixed audio, so essentially audio was being
	  lost. One result of this was chan_spy's whisper mode no longer
	  worked. To complicate the issue, frames passed into ast_write may
	  either be a single frame, or a list of frames. So, as the list of

	  lines Rework of T.38 negotiation and UDPTL API to address
	  interoperability problems Over the past couple of months, a
	  number of issues with Asterisk negotiating (and successfully
	  completing) T.38 sessions with various endpoints have been found.
	  This patch attempts to address many of them, primarily focused
	  around ensuring that the endpoints' MaxDatagram size is honored,
	  and in addition by ensuring that T.38 session parameter
	  negotiation is performed correctly according to the ITU T.38
	  Recommendation. The major changes here are: 1) T.38 applications
	  in Asterisk (app_fax) only generate/receive IFP packets, they do
	  not ever work with UDPTL packets. As a result of this, they
	  cannot be allowed to generate packets that would overflow the
	  other endpoints' MaxDatagram size after the UDPTL stack adds any
	  error correction information. With this patch, the application is
	  told the maximum *IFP* size it can generate, based on a
	  calculation using the far end MaxDatagram size and the active
	  error correction mode on the T.38 session. The same is true for
	  sending *our* MaxDatagram size to the remote endpoint; it is
	  computed from the value that the application says it can accept
	  (for a single IFP packet) combined with the active error
	  correction mode. 2) All treatment of T.38 session parameters as
	  'capabilities' in chan_sip has been removed; these parameters are
	  not at all like audio/video stream capabilities. There are strict
	  rules to follow for computing an answer to a T.38 offer, and
	  chan_sip now follows those rules, using the desired parameters
	  from the application (or channel) that wants to accept the T.38
	  negotiation. 3) chan_sip now stores and forwards
	  ast_control_t38_parameters structures for tracking 'our' and
	  'their' T.38 session parameters; this greatly simplifies
	  negotiation, especially for pass-through calls. 4) Since T.38
	  negotiation without specifying parameters or receiving the final
	  negotiated parameters is not very worthwhile, the AST_CONTROL_T38
	  control frame has been removed. A note has been added to
	  UPGRADE.txt about this removal, since any out-of-tree
	  applications that use it will no longer function properly until
	  they are upgraded to use AST_CONTROL_T38_PARAMETERS. Review:

	  yet received an ACK from that endpoint for the initial INVITE it
	  had sent us. This expansion also allows Asterisk to appropriately
	  handle an INVITE with authorization credentials if Asterisk had
	  not received an ACK from the previous transaction in which
	  Asterisk had responded to an unauthorized INVITE with a 407.

	  the compiler/linker *after* all flags provided by the build
	  system itself, so that the user can effectively override the
	  build system's flags if desired. In addition, ASTCFLAGS and
	  ASTLDFLAGS can now be provided *either* in the environment before
	  running 'make', or as variable assignments on the 'make' command
	  line. As a result, the use of COPTS and LDOPTS is no longer
	  necessary, so they are no longer documented, but are still
	  supported so as not to break existing build systems that supply
	  them when building Asterisk. ........ ................

	  2009) | 33 lines Answer video SDP offers properly when
	  videosupport is not enabled. Copied from Review board: In issue
	  12434, the reporter describes a situation in which audio and
	  video is offered on the call, but because videosupport is
	  disabled in sip.conf, Asterisk gives no response at all to the
	  video offer. According to RFC 3264, all media offers should have
	  a corresponding answer. For offers we do not intend to actually
	  reply to with meaningful values, we should still reply with the
	  port for the media stream set to 0. In this patch, we take note
	  of what types of media have been offered and save the information
	  on the sip_pvt. The SDP in the response will take into account
	  whether media was offered. If we are not otherwise going to
	  answer a media offer, we will insert an appropriate m= line with
	  the port set to 0. It is important to note that this patch is
	  pretty much a bandage being applied to a broken bone. The patch
	  *only* helps for situations where video is offered but
	  videosupport is disabled and when udptl_pt is disabled but T.38
	  is offered. Asterisk is not guaranteed to respond to every media
	  offer. Notable cases are when multiple streams of the same type
	  are offered. The 2 media stream limit is still present with this
	  patch, too. In trunk and the 1.6.X branches, things will be a bit
	  different since Asterisk also supports text in SDPs as well.

	  .......... Fixed chan_misdn crash because mISDNuser library is
	  not thread safe. With Asterisk the mISDNuser library is driven by
	  two threads concurrently: 1.
	  channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c::manager_event_handler() 2.
	  channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c::misdn_lib_isdn_event_catcher() Calls
	  into the library are done concurrently and recursively from
	  isdn_lib.c. Both threads can fiddle with the master/child
	  layer3_proc_t lists. One thread may traverse the list when the
	  other interrupts it and then removes the list element which the
	  first thread was currently handling. This is exactly what caused
	  the crash. About 60 calls were needed to a Gigaset CX475 before
	  it occurred once. This patch adds locking when calling into the
	  mISDNuser library. This also fixes some cb_log calls with wrong
	  port parameter. JIRA ABE-1913 Patches: misdn-locking.patch

	  issue #14355 - Crash if attempt to transfer a call to an
	  application. Masquerade the other pair of the four asterisk
	  channels involved in the two calls. The held call already must be
	  a bridged call (not an applicaton) or it would have been
	  rejected. * issue #14692 - Held calls are not automatically
	  cleared after transfer. Allow the core to initate disconnect of
	  held calls to the ISDN port. This also fixes a similar case where
	  the party on hold hangs up before being transferred or taken off
	  hold. * JIRA ABE-1903 - Orphaned held calls left in
	  music-on-hold. Do not simply block passing the hangup event on
	  held calls to asterisk core. * Fixed to allow held calls to be
	  transferred to ringing calls. Previously, held calls could only
	  be transferred to connected calls. * Eliminated unused call
	  states to simplify hangup code. * Eliminated most uses of
	  "holded" because it is not a word. (closes issue #14355) (closes

	  | 31 lines SIP registration auth loop caused by stale nonce If an
	  endpoint sends two registration requests in a very short period
	  of time with the same nonce, both receive 401 responses from
	  Asterisk, each with a different nonce (the second 401 containing
	  the current nonce and the first one being stale). If the endpoint
	  responds to the first 401, it does not match the current nonce so
	  Asterisk sends a third 401 with a newly generated nonce (which
	  updates the current nonce)... Now if the endpoint responds to the
	  second 401, it does not match the current nonce either and
	  Asterisk sends a fourth 401 with a newly generated nonce... This
	  loop goes on and on. There appears to be a simple fix for this.
	  If the nonce from the request does not match our nonce, but is a
	  good response to a previous nonce, instead of sending a 401 with
	  a newly generated nonce, use the current one instead. This breaks
	  the loop as the nonce is not updated until a response is
	  received. Additional logic has been added to make sure no nonce
	  can be responded to twice though. (closes issue #15102) Reported

	  Move OpenSSL initialization to a single place, make library usage
	  thread-safe. While doing some reading about OpenSSL, I noticed a
	  couple of things that needed to be improved with our usage of
	  OpenSSL. 1) We had initialization of the library done in multiple
	  modules. This has now been moved to a core function that gets
	  executed during Asterisk startup. We already link OpenSSL into
	  the core for TCP/TLS functionality, so this was the most logical
	  place to do it. 2) OpenSSL is not thread-safe by default.
	  However, making it thread safe is very easy. We just have to
	  provide a couple of callbacks. One callback returns a thread ID.
	  The other handles locking. For more information, start with the
	  "Is OpenSSL thread-safe?" question on the FAQ page of
	  openssl.org. ........

	  but valid responses. chan_sip has had a problem for quite a long
	  time that would manifest when Asterisk would send multiple SIP
	  responses on the same dialog before receiving a response. The
	  problem occurred because chan_sip only kept track of the highest
	  outgoing sequence number used on the dialog. If Asterisk sent two
	  requests out, and a response arrived for the first request sent,
	  then Asterisk would ignore the response. The result was that
	  Asterisk would continue retransmitting the requests and ignoring
	  the responses until the maximum number of retransmissions had
	  been reached. The fix here is to rearrange the code a bit so that
	  instead of simply comparing the sequence number of the response
	  to our latest outgoing sequence number, we walk our list of
	  outstanding packets and determine if there is a match. If there
	  is, we continue. If not, then we ignore the response. In doing
	  this, I found a few completely useless variables that I have now
	  removed. (closes issue #11231) Reported by: flefoll Review:

	  exclusively pick B channels. (There may be other devices on the

	  2009) | 26 lines Fix a situation in which Asterisk would not stop
	  retransmitting 487s. If a CANCEL were received by Asterisk, we
	  would send a 487 in response to the original INVITE and a 200 OK
	  for the CANCEL. If there were a network hiccup which caused the
	  200 OK and the 487 to be lost, then the UA communicating with
	  Asterisk may try to retransmit its CANCEL. Asterisk's response to
	  this used to be to try sending another 487 to the canceled INVITE
	  and another 200 OK to the CANCEL. The problem here is that the
	  originally-sent 487 was sent "reliably" meaning that it will be
	  retransmitted until it is received properly. So when we receive
	  the second CANCEL it is likely that the first batch of 487s we
	  sent is still going strong and reaches the UA. The result was
	  that the second set of 487s would be retransmitted constantly
	  until the maximum number of retries had been reached. The fix for
	  this is that if we receive a second CANCEL for an INVITE, then we
	  cancel the retransmission of the first set of 487s and start a
	  second set. This causes the dialog to be terminated reasonably.

	  | 29 lines Fix memory corruption and leakage related reloads of
	  non files mode MoH classes. For Music on Hold classes that are
	  not files mode, meaning that we are executing an application that
	  will feed us audio data, we use a thread to monitor the external
	  application and read audio from it. This thread also makes use of
	  the MoH class object. In the MoH class destructor, we used
	  pthread_cancel() to ask the thread to exit. Unfortunately, the
	  code did not wait to ensure that the thread actually went away.
	  What needed to be done is a pthread_join() to ensure that the
	  thread fully cleans up before we proceed. By adding this one
	  line, we resolve two significant problems: 1) Since the thread
	  was never joined, it never fully goes away. So, on every reload
	  of non-files mode MoH, an unused thread was sticking around. 2)
	  There was a race condition here where the application monitoring
	  thread could still try to access the MoH class, even though the
	  thread executing the MoH reload has already destroyed it. (issue

	  lines Fix problem with no audio due to ignoring the SDP. A recent
	  change to our SDP version comparison made audio not function on
	  some calls. This was because of a test wherein we were trying to
	  see if an unsigned value was less than 0. This is a dumb
	  comparison and arguably the compiler should have warned about it.
	  Alas, though, it slipped past. Now it's fixed by changing the
	  variable to be a signed type. Found by several developers. Tested
	  by mnicholson and dbrooks. ........

	  SIP transport type issues What this patch addresses: 1.
	  ast_sip_ouraddrfor() by default binds to the UDP address/port
	  reguardless if the sip->pvt is of type UDP or not. Now when no
	  remapping is required, ast_sip_ouraddrfor() checks the sip_pvt's
	  transport type, attempting to set the address and port to the
	  correct TCP/TLS bindings if necessary. 2. It is not necessary to
	  send the port number in the Contact header unless the port is
	  non-standard for the transport type. This patch fixes this and
	  removes the todo note. 3. In sip_alloc(), the default dialog
	  built always uses transport type UDP. Now sip_alloc() looks at
	  the sip_request (if present) and determines what transport type
	  to use by default. 4. When changing the transport type of a
	  sip_socket, the file descriptor must be set to -1 and in some
	  cases the tcptls_session's ref count must be decremented and set
	  to NULL. I've encountered several issues associated with this
	  process and have created a function, set_socket_transport(), to
	  handle the setting of the socket type. (closes issue #13865)

	  SDP version number as they should. If this situation occurs, a

	  configuration be changed to include the 'ignoresdpversion'

	  which a module's load() function is initialized. The lower the
	  value, the higher the priority. The value is only checked if the
	  AST_MODFLAG_LOAD_ORDER flag is set. If the AST_MODFLAG_LOAD_ORDER
	  flag is not set, the value will never be read and the module will
	  be given the lowest possible priority on load. Since some modules
	  are reliant on a timing interface, the timing modules have been

	  2009) | 40 lines Safely handle AMI connections/reload requests
	  that occur during startup. During asterisk startup, a lock on the
	  list of modules is obtained by the primary thread while each
	  module is initialized. Issue 13778 pointed out a problem with
	  this approach, however. Because the AMI is loaded before other
	  modules, it is possible for a module reload to be issued by a
	  connected client (via Action: Command), causing a deadlock. The
	  resolution for 13778 was to move initialization of the manager to
	  happen after the other modules had already been lodaded. While
	  this fixed this particular issue, it caused a problem for users
	  (like FreePBX) who call AMI scripts via an #exec in a
	  configuration file (See issue 15189). The solution I have come up
	  with is to defer any reload requests that come in until after the
	  server is fully booted. When a call comes in to ast_module_reload
	  (from wherever) before we are fully booted, the request is added
	  to a queue of pending requests. Once we are done booting up, we
	  then execute these deferred requests in turn. Note that I have
	  tried to make this a bit more intelligent in that it will not
	  queue up more than 1 request for the same module to be reloaded,
	  and if a general reload request comes in ('module reload') the
	  queue is flushed and we only issue a single deferred reload for
	  the entire system. As for how this will impact existing
	  installations - Before 13778, a reload issued before module
	  initialization was completed would result in a deadlock. After
	  13778, you simply couldn't connect to the manager during startup
	  (which causes problems with #exec-that-calls-AMI configuration
	  files). I believe this is a good general purpose solution that
	  won't negatively impact existing installations. (closes issue

	  | 38 lines Resolve issues with choppy sound when using
	  res_timing_pthread. The situation that caused this problem was
	  when continuous mode was being turned on and off while a rate was
	  set for a timing interface. A very easy way to replicate this bug
	  was to do a Playback() from behind a Local channel. In this
	  scenario, a rate gets set on the channel for doing file playback.
	  At the same time, continuous mode gets turned on and off about
	  every 20 ms as frames get queued on to the PBX side channel from
	  the other side of the Local channel. Essentially, this module
	  treated continuous mode and a set rate as mutually exclusive
	  states for the timer to be in. When I dug deep enough, I observed
	  the following pattern: 1) Set timer to tick every 20 ms. 2) Wait
	  almost 20 ms ... 3) Continuous mode gets turned on for a queued
	  up frame 4) Continuous mode gets turned off 5) The timer goes
	  back to its tick per 20 ms. state but starts counting at 0 ms. 6)
	  Goto step 2. Sometimes, res_timing_pthread would make it 20 ms
	  and produce a timer tick, but not most of the time. This is what
	  produced the choppy sound (or sometimes no sound at all). Now,
	  the module treats continuous mode and a set rate as completely
	  independent timer modes. They can be enabled and disabled
	  independently of each other and things work as expected. (closes

	  SIP set outbound transport type from Registration In sip.conf the
	  transport option allows for the configuration of what transport
	  types (udp, tcp, and tls) a peer will accept, but only the first
	  type listed was used for outbound connections. This patch changes
	  this. Now the default transport type is only used until the peer
	  registers. When registration takes place the transport type is
	  parsed out of the Contact header. If the Contact header's
	  transport type is equal to one that the peer supports, the peer's
	  default transport type for outbound connections is set to match
	  the Contact header's type. If the Contact header's transport type
	  is not present, then the peer's default transport type is set to
	  match the one the peer registered with. When a peer unregisters
	  or the registration expires, the default transport type for that
	  peer is reset. (closes issue #12282) Reported by: rjain Patches:

	  | 14 lines Sign problem calculating timestamp for iax frame leads
	  to no audio on the receiving peer. There are rare cases in which
	  a frame's delivery timestamp is slightly less than the iax2_pvt's
	  offset. This causes the pvt's timestamp to be a small negative
	  number, but since the timestamp value is unsigned it looks like a
	  huge positive number. This patch checks for this negative case
	  and sets the ms to zero. A similar check is already done right
	  below this one in the 'else' statement. (closes issue #15032)

	  AST_CDR_FLAG_ANSLOCKED and AST_CDR_FLAG_LOCKED from being updated
	  in certain cases. This is accomplished by adding two functions to
	  update the answer time and disposition of calls that checks for
	  the proper lock flags. These functions are used in the
	  ast_bridge_call() function so that ForkCDR(A) calls are
	  respected. This patch also modifies the way ast_bridge_call()
	  chooses the cdr record to base the bridged_cdr on. Previously the
	  first unlocked cdr record would be chosen, now instead the first
	  cdr record is chosen and forked cdr records are moved to the
	  bridge_cdr. This allows the original cdr record and any forked
	  cdr records to be properly updated with answer and end times.

	  2009) | 24 lines Fix a race condition where a reinvite could
	  trigger a 482 response. The loop detection/spiral detection code
	  in chan_sip used the owner channel's state as a criterion for
	  determining if the incoming INVITE is a looped request. The
	  problem with this is that the INVITE-handling code happens in a
	  different thread than the thread that marks the owner channel as
	  being up. As a result, if a reinvite were to come in very
	  quickly, say from another Asterisk on the same LAN, it was
	  possible for the reinvite to arrive before the owner channel had
	  been set to the up state. This patch corrects the problem by
	  using the invitestate of the sip_pvt instead, since that can be
	  guaranteed to be set correctly by the time the reinvite arrives.
	  Since there is a switch statement further in the INVITE-handling
	  code, the AST_STATE_RINGING state also checks the invitestate of
	  the sip_pvt in case we should actually be treating the channel as
	  if it were up already. (closes issue #12215) Reported by: jpyle

	  lines Update spiral support in trunk and 1.6.X to match what is
	  in 1.4. In 1.4, a SIP spiral is treated the same way as a call
	  forward. This works much better than what is currently in trunk
	  and 1.6.X. The code in trunk and 1.6.X did not create a new call
	  to the recipient of the spiral, instead trying to continue the
	  same call. In addition to just being plain wrong, this also had
	  the side effect of only being able to spiral calls to other SIP
	  channels. With this in place, as long as call forwards are
	  honored, SIP spirals will work properly. This means that it will
	  work for outbound calls made by the Queue, Dial, and Page
	  applications. For originated calls and spool calls, however, the
	  spiral will not work properly until a generic call forward
	  mechanism is introduced into Asterisk. (relates to issue #13630)

	  Fixes segfault when switching UDP to TCP in sip.conf after
	  reload. If transport in sip.conf is switched from UDP to TCP,
	  Asterisk segfaults right after issuing a sip reload. The problem
	  is the socket type is changed to TCP but the fd may still be
	  present for UDP. Later, when the TCP session should be created or
	  set using an existing one, it isn't because the old file
	  descriptor is still present. Now every time transport is changed
	  during a sip.conf reload, the file descriptor is set to -1,
	  signifying it must be created or found. (closes issue #14727)

	  | 10 lines Fixes issue with dropped calles due to re-Invite glare
	  and re-Invites never executing after a 491 Acknowledgement for
	  491 responses were never being processed because it didn't match
	  our pending invite's seqno. Since the ACK was never processed,
	  the 491 frame would continue to be retransmitted until eventually
	  the call was dropped due to max retries. Now during a pending
	  invite, if we receive another invite, we send an 491 and hold on
	  to that glare invite's seqno in the "glareinvite" variable for
	  that sip_pvt struct. When ACK's are received, we first check to
	  see if it is in response to our pending invite, if not we check
	  to see if it is in response to a glare invite. In this case, it
	  is in response to the glare invite and must be dealt with or the
	  call is dropped. I've changed the wait time for resending the
	  re-Invite after receving a 491 response to comply with RFC 3261.
	  Before this patch the scheduled re-Invite would only change a
	  flag indicating that the re-Invite should be sent out, now it
	  actually sends it out as well. (closes issue #12013) Reported by:

	  cached realtime moh. The moh_register function links an mohclass
	  and then immediately unrefs the class since the container now has
	  a reference. The problem with using realtime music on hold is
	  that the class is allocated, registered, and started in one fell
	  swoop. The refcounting logic resulted in the count being off by
	  one. The same problem did not happen when using a static config
	  because the allocation and registration of an mohclass is a
	  separate operation from starting moh. This also did not affect
	  non-cached realtime moh because the classes are not registered at
	  all. I also have modified res_musiconhold to use the _t_ variants
	  of the ao2_ functions so that more info can be gleaned when
	  attempting to trace the refcounts. I found this to be incredibly

	  message printed in ast_read(). "ast_read() called with no
	  recorded file descriptor" is a new message added after a bug was
	  discovered. Unfortunately, it seems there are a bunch of places
	  that potentially make such calls to ast_read() and trigger this
	  error message to be displayed. This commit does two things to
	  help to make this message appear less. First, the message has
	  been downgraded to a debug level message if dev mode is not
	  enabled. The message means a lot more to developers than it does
	  to end users, and so developers should take an effort to be sure
	  to call ast_read only when a channel is ready to be read from.
	  However, since this doesn't actually cause an error in operation
	  and is not something a user can easily fix, we should not spam
	  their console with these messages. Second, the message has been
	  moved to after the check for any pending masquerades. ast_read()
	  being called with no recorded file descriptor should not
	  interfere with a masquerade taking place. This could be seen as a
	  simple way of resolving issue #14723. However, I still want to
	  try to clear out the existing ways of triggering this message,
	  since I feel that would be a better resolution for the issue.

	  Update some comments and resolve potential memory corruption in

	  Given that it could cause memory corruption, I have removed it.
	  There was also a TODO comment left describing a potential
	  implementation of an improvement to the needdestroy handling. I'm
	  not convinced that what was described is the best choice here, so
	  I have briefly described the way that this function is used today

	  while doing some testing of my ast_channel_ao2 branch. After
	  running a test overnight that generated over 5 million calls,
	  Asterisk had taken up about 1 GB of my system memory. So, I
	  re-ran the test with MALLOC_DEBUG turned on. However, it showed
	  no leaks in Asterisk during the test, even though Asterisk was
	  still consuming it somehow. Instead, I turned to valgrind, which
	  when run with --leak-check=full, told me exactly where the leak
	  came from, which was from allocations inside the radiusclient-ng
	  library. This explains why MALLOC_DEBUG did not report it. After
	  a bit of analysis, I found that we were leaking a little bit of
	  memory every time a CDR record was passed to cdr_radius. I don't
	  actually have a radius server set up to receive CDR records.
	  However, I always have my development systems compile and install
	  all modules. In addition to making sure there are not build
	  errors across modules, always loading modules helps find bugs
	  like this, too, so it is strongly recommend for all developers.

	  | 35 lines Fix incorrect parsing in chan_gtalk when xmpp contains
	  extra whitespaces To drill into the xmpp to find the capabilities
	  between channels, chan_gtalk calls iks_child() and iks_next().
	  iks_child() and iks_next() are functions in the iksemel xml
	  parsing library that traverse xml nodes. The bug here is that
	  both iks_child() and iks_next() will return the next iks_struct
	  node *regardless* of type. chan_gtalk expects the next node to be
	  of type IKS_TAG, which in most cases, it is, but in this case (a
	  call being made from the Empathy IM client), there exists
	  iks_struct nodes which are not IKS_TAG data (they are extraneous
	  whitespaces), and chan_gtalk doesn't handle that case, so
	  capabilities don't match, and a call cannot be made.
	  iks_first_tag() and iks_next_tag(), on the other hand, will not
	  return the very next iks_struct, but will check to see if the
	  next iks_struct is of type IKS_TAG. If it isn't, it will be
	  skipped, and the next struct of type IKS_TAG it finds will be
	  returned. This assures that chan_gtalk will find the iks_struct
	  it is looking for. This fix simply changes all calls to
	  iks_child() and iks_next() to become calls to iks_first_tag() and
	  iks_next_tag(), which resolves the capability matching. The
	  following is a payload listing from Empathy, which, due to the
	  extraneous whitespace, will not be parsed correctly by iksemel:

	  2009) | 39 lines Fix queue weight behavior so that calls in
	  low-weight queues are not inappropriately blocked. (This is
	  copied and pasted from the review request I made for this patch)
	  Asterisk has some odd behavior when queue weights are used. The
	  current logic used when potentially calling a queue member is: If
	  the member we are going to call is part of another queue and
	  _that other queue has any callers in it_ and has a higher weight
	  than the queue we are calling from, then don't try to contact
	  that member. The issue here is what I have marked with
	  underscores. If the higher-weighted queue has any callers in it
	  at all, then the queue member will be unreachable from the
	  lower-weighted queue. This has the potential to be really really
	  bad if using a queue strategy, such as leastrecent or
	  fewestcalls, with the potential to call the same member
	  repeatedly. The fix proposed by garychen on issue 13220 is very
	  simple and, as far as I can see, works well for this situation.
	  With this set of changes, the logic used becomes: If the member
	  we are going to call is part of another queue, the other queue
	  has a higher weight than the queue we are calling from, and the
	  higher weight queue has at least as many callers as available
	  members, then do not try to contact the queue member. If the
	  higher weighted queue has fewer callers than available members,
	  then there is no reason to deny the call to this member since the
	  other queue can afford to spare a member. Since the fix involved
	  writing a generic function for determining the number of
	  available members in the queue, I also modified the is_our_turn
	  function to make use of the new num_available_members function to
	  determine if it is our turn to try calling a member. There is one
	  small behavior change. Before writing this patch, if you had
	  autofill disabled, then if you were the head caller in a queue,
	  you would automatically be told that it was your turn to try
	  calling a member. This did not take into account whether there
	  were actually any queue members available to take the call. Now
	  we actually make sure there is at least one member available to
	  take the call if autofill is disabled. (closes issue #13220)

	  Mar 2009) | 35 lines Improve performance of the ast_event cache
	  functionality. This code comes from
	  svn/asterisk/team/russell/event_performance/. Here is a summary
	  of the changes that have been made, in order of both invasiveness
	  and performance impact, from smallest to largest. 1) Asterisk
	  1.6.1 introduces some additional logic to be able to handle
	  distributed device state. This functionality comes at a cost. One
	  relatively minor change in this patch is that the extra
	  processing required for distributed device state is now
	  completely bypassed if it's not needed. 2) One of the things that
	  I noticed when profiling this code was that a _lot_ of time was
	  spent doing string comparisons. I changed the way strings are
	  represented in an event to include a hash value at the front. So,
	  before doing a string comparison, we do an integer comparison on
	  the hash. 3) Finally, the code that handles the event cache has
	  been re-written. I tried to do this in a such a way that it had
	  minimal impact on the API. I did have to change one API call,
	  though - ast_event_queue_and_cache(). However, the way it works
	  now is nicer, IMO. Each type of event that can be cached (MWI,
	  device state) has its own hash table and rules for hashing and
	  comparing objects. This by far made the biggest impact on
	  performance. For additional details regarding this code and how
	  it was tested, please see the review request. (closes issue

	  | 44 lines Fix cases where the internal poll() was not being used
	  when it needed to be. We have seen a number of problems caused by
	  poll() not working properly on Mac OSX. If you search around,
	  you'll find a number of references to using select() instead of
	  poll() to work around these issues. In Asterisk, we've had poll.c
	  which implements poll() using select() internally. However, we
	  were still getting reports of problems. vadim investigated a bit
	  and realized that at least on his system, even though we were
	  compiling in poll.o, the system poll() was still being used. So,
	  the primary purpose of this patch is to ensure that we're using
	  the internal poll() when we want it to be used. The changes are:
	  1) Remove logic for when internal poll should be used from the
	  Makefile. Instead, put it in the configure script. The logic in
	  the configure script is the same as it was in the Makefile.
	  Ideally, we would have a functionality test for the problem, but
	  that's not actually possible, since we would have to be able to
	  run an application on the _target_ system to test poll()
	  behavior. 2) Always include poll.o in the build, but it will be
	  empty if AST_POLL_COMPAT is not defined. 3) Change uses of poll()
	  throughout the source tree to ast_poll(). I feel that it is good
	  practice to give the API call a new name when we are changing its
	  behavior and not using the system version directly in all cases.
	  So, normally, ast_poll() is just redefined to poll(). On systems
	  where AST_POLL_COMPAT is defined, ast_poll() is redefined to
	  ast_internal_poll(). 4) Change poll() in main/poll.c to be
	  ast_internal_poll(). It's worth noting that any code that still
	  uses poll() directly will work fine (if they worked fine before).
	  So, for example, out of tree modules that are using poll() will
	  not stop working or anything. However, for modules to work
	  properly on Mac OSX, ast_poll() needs to be used. (closes issue

	  Allow H.323 Plus library to be used in addition to the OpenH323
	  library Chan_h323 can now be compiled against both the previously
	  supported versions of OpenH323 as well as the current H.323 Plus
	  (version 1.20.2). The configure script has been modified to look
	  in the default install location of h323 to hopefully help avoid
	  using the environment variables OPENH323DIR and PWLIBDIR. Also,
	  the CLI command "h323 show version" has been added which
	  indicates which version of h323 is in use. (closes issue #11261)

	  lines Improve behavior of ast_answer() to not lose incoming
	  frames ast_answer(), when supplied a delay before returning to
	  the caller, use ast_safe_sleep() to implement the delay.
	  Unfortunately during this time any incoming frames are discarded,
	  which is problematic for T.38 re-INVITES and other sorts of
	  channel operations. When a delay is not passed to ast_answer(),
	  it still delays for up to 500 milliseconds, waiting for media to
	  arrive. Again, though, it discards any control frames, or
	  non-voice media frames. This patch rectifies this situation, by
	  storing all incoming frames during the delay period on a list,
	  and then requeuing them onto the channel before returning to the
	  caller. http://reviewboard.digium.com/r/196/ ........

	  CHANGES, makeopts.in: Add MFC/R2 support for chan_dahdi. This
	  commit introduces official support for R2 signaling in
	  chan_dahdi. The modifications to chan_dahdi, and the supporting
	  library, LibOpenR2, were both written by Moises Silva. Many users
	  are using this code, or a variant of it, in Asterisk 1.2, 1.4 and
	  1.6 in Brazil, México and Argentina. An unknown number of users
	  (but at least 1) are using it in each of the following countries:
	  Colombia, Nepal, Thailand, Venezuela, Perú, and probably others.
	  To use this code, LibOpenR2 must be installed from
	  http://www.libopenr2.org/. Information about configuration can be
	  found in configs/chan_dahdi.conf.sample. The code committed is
	  the most up to date version, which was being maintained in
	  svn/asterisk/team/moy/mfcr2/. I would also like to include a
	  Thank You to the many others that tested this code beyond those
	  listed in this commit message. These are the names that I could
	  find in the mantis issue. (closes issue #12509) Reported by: moy

	  2009) | 35 lines Check the DYNAMIC_FEATURES of both the chan and
	  peer when interpreting DTMF. Dynamic features defined in the
	  applicationmap section of features.conf allow one to specify
	  whether the caller, callee, or both have the ability to use the
	  feature. The documentation in the features.conf.sample file could
	  be interpreted to mean that one only needs to set the
	  DYNAMIC_FEATURES channel variable on the calling channel in order
	  to allow for the callee to be able to use the features which he
	  should have permission to use. However, the DYNAMIC_FEATURES
	  variable would only be read from the channel of the participant
	  that pressed the DTMF sequence to activate the feature. The
	  result of this was that the callee was unable to use dynamic
	  features unless the dialplan writer had taken measures to be sure
	  that the DYNAMIC_FEATURES variable was set on the callee's
	  channel. This commit changes the behavior of
	  ast_feature_interpret to concatenate the values of
	  DYNAMIC_FEATURES from both parties involved in the bridge. The
	  features themselves determine who has permission to use them, so
	  there is no reason to believe that one side of the bridge could
	  gain the ability to perform an action that they should not have
	  the ability to perform. Kevin Fleming pointed out on the
	  asterisk-users list that the typical way that this was worked
	  around in the past was by setting _DYNAMIC_FEATURES on the
	  calling channel so that the value would be inherited by the
	  called channel. While this works, the documentation alone is not
	  enough to figure out why this is necessary for the callee to be
	  able to use dynamic features. In this particular case, changing
	  the code to match the documentation is safe, easy, and will
	  generally make things easier for people for future installations.
	  This bug was originally reported on the asterisk-users list by
	  David Ruggles. (closes issue #14657) Reported by: mmichelson

	  before we have sent a final response for the INVITE, then we need

	  prior to this commit which seemed to exist solely to handle this
	  situation, but there was one condition in an if statement which
	  was incorrect. The only way we would send a 487 was if the
	  sip_pvt had no owner channel. This made no sense since we created
	  the owner channel when we received the INVITE, meaning that the
	  majority of the time we would never send the 487. The 487 being
	  sent should not rely on whether we have created a channel. Its
	  delivery should be dependent on the current state of the initial
	  INVITE transaction. With this commit, that logic is now correctly

	  thereby causing the proper debug macros to not be used.
	  ast_h323.cxx has been changed to call ast_free instead to avoid
	  the issue. A few other issues were addressed: - There were a few
	  instances of functions improperly passing ast_free instead of
	  ast_free_ptr. - Some clean up was done to avoid the debug macros
	  intentionally being redefined. (copied below from Kevin's commit,
	  appreciate the help) - disable astmm.h from doing anything when
	  STANDALONE is defined, which is used by the tools in the utils/
	  directory that use parts of Asterisk header files in hackish

	  feel free to supplement what is there. The current method of
	  documenting is to add (in the header file): \version <ver number>
	  <description of changes> and then to add the function to the
	  change list in doxyref.h on the AstAPIChanges page. I also made
	  sure all the functions that were newly added were tagged with
	  \since 1.6.1. I think this is a good habit to start both for the
	  historical aspect as well as for the future ability to easily add
	  a "New Asterisk API" page. Review:

	  | 9 lines Fix handling of backreferences for ENUM lookups enum.c
	  did not handle regex backtraces correctly. The '\1' in the regex
	  is a backreference that requires a pattern match to be inserted.
	  The way the code used to work is that it would find the
	  backreference and insert the entire input string minus the '+'.
	  This is incorrect. The regexec() function takes in a variable
	  called pmatch which is an array of structs containing the start
	  and end indexes for each backreference substring. The original
	  code actually passed the pmatch array pointer into regexec but
	  never did anything with it. Now when a backtrace is found, the
	  backtrace number is looked up in the pmatch array and the correct
	  substring is inserted. (closes issue #14576) Reported by:

	  option is enabled. When using the searchcontexts option in
	  voicemail.conf, the code made the assumption that all mailbox
	  names defined were unique across all contexts. However, the code
	  did nothing to actually enforce this assumption, nor did it do
	  anything to alert a user that he may have created an ambiguity in
	  his voicemail.conf file by defining the same mailbox name in
	  multiple contexts. With this change, we now will issue a nice
	  long warning if searchcontexts is on and we encounter the same
	  mailbox name in multiple contexts and ignore any duplicates after
	  the first box. Whether searchcontexts is enabled or not, if we
	  come across a duplicate mailbox in the same context, then we will
	  issue a warning and ignore the duplicated mailbox. I have also
	  added a small note to voicemail.conf.sample in the explanation
	  for searchcontexts explaining that you cannot define the same
	  mailbox in multiple contexts if you have enabled the option.

	  This is not good. This patch changes this behavior, so that if

	  existing smoother is safely updated to use the new size, and if
	  no smoother was present, one is created. A new API call for

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Resolve object matching issues related to
	  the removal of the sip_user object. Previously, chan_sip had both
	  sip_peer and sip_user objects in memory. A patch went in to
	  remove sip_user to simplify the code, since everything could be
	  done with just sip_peer. This patch resolves some regressions
	  found that were introduced by those changes. This code comes from
	  svn/asterisk/team/group/sip-object-matching/. Here is a list of
	  the changes that have been made: 1) When doing a match by name
	  with the find_peer() function, make it much easier to specify
	  which objects should be matched by having a parameter that
	  specifies exactly which object types should be considered. Also,
	  update find_by_name() to handle this parameter. Finally, update
	  all code to use the new option values. 2) When looking up an
	  object for an outbound request by name, consider peers only.
	  (create_addr()) 3) Only match peers on an incoming registration
	  request. 4) When doing authentication (except for SUBSCRIBE),
	  look up users by name, instead of all objects by name. 5) When
	  doing authentication (except for SUBSCRIBE), after looking for a
	  user by name, look for a peer by IP address, instead of all
	  objects by IP address. 6) When handling the SIP qualify CLI
	  command or manager action, look for a peer by name, instead of
	  any object by name. 7) When handling the SIP unregister CLI
	  command, look for a peer by name, instead of any object by name.
	  9) In sip_do_debug_peer(), search for a peer by name, instead of
	  any object by name. 9) When handling the SIPPEER() dialplan
	  function, search for a peer by name, instead of any object by
	  name. 10) In the following session timer related functions,
	  st_get_se(), st_get_refresher(), and st_get_mode(), when looking
	  for an object for a given sip_pvt using pvt->peername, look for a
	  peer by name, instead of any object by name. 11) Fix build_peer()
	  to properly handle the case where separate type=peer and
	  type=user entries were specified in sip.conf. (closes issue

	  | 40 lines Move ast_waitfor() down to avoid the results of the
	  API call becoming stale. This call to ast_waitfor() was being
	  done way too soon in this section of code. Specifically, there
	  was code in between the call to waitfor and the code that uses
	  the result that puts the channel in autoservice. By putting the
	  channel in autoservice, the previous results of ast_waitfor()
	  become meaningless, as the autoservice thread will do it's own
	  ast_waitfor() and ast_read() on the channel. So, when we came
	  back out of autoservice and eventually hit the block of code that
	  calls ast_read() on the channel, there may not actually be any
	  input on the channel available. Even though the previous call to
	  ast_waitfor() in app_meetme said there was input, the autoservice
	  thread has since serviced the channel for some period of time.
	  This bug manifested itself while dvossel was doing some testing
	  of MeetMe in Asterisk trunk. He was using the timerfd timing
	  module. When the code hit ast_read() erroneously, it determined
	  that it must have been called because of input on the timer fd,
	  as chan->fdno was set to AST_TIMING_FD, since that was the cause
	  of the last legitimate call to ast_read() done by autoservice. In
	  this test, an IAX2 channel was calling into the MeetMe
	  conference. It was _much_ more likely to be seen with an IAX2
	  channel because of the way audio is handled. Every audio frame
	  that comes in results in a call to ast_queue_frame(), which then
	  uses ast_timer_enable_continuous() to notify the channel thread
	  that a frame is waiting to be handled. So, the chances of
	  ast_waitfor() indicating that a channel needs servicing due to a
	  timer event on an IAX2 event is very high. Finally, it is
	  interesting to note that if a different timing interface was
	  being used, this bug would probably not be noticed. When
	  ast_read() is called and erroneously thinks that there is a timer
	  event to handle, it calls the ast_timer_ack() function. The
	  pthread and dahdi timing modules handle the ack() function being
	  called when there is no event by simply ignoring it. In the case
	  of the timerfd module, it results in a read() on the timer fd
	  that will block forever, as there is no data to read. This caused
	  Asterisk to lock up very quickly. Thanks to dvossel and
	  mmichelson for the fun debugging session. :-) ........

	  28 lines This patch prevents the feature detection timeout from
	  being cut in half. Because the ast_channel_bridge() call will
	  return 0 and pass a frame pointer for both DTMF_BEGIN and
	  DTMF_END, the feature_timer field in hte config struct is getting
	  decremented twice, which effectively cuts the digittimeout in
	  half. I added conditions to the if statement to only let DTMF_END
	  frames to flow thru, which solved the problem. Also, when the
	  frame pointer is null, let control flow thru-- this usually
	  happens on timeouts. I added a comment to the code to explain
	  what's going on and why. Many thanks to sodom for reporting this
	  problem. Personnally, it always seemed like something was wrong
	  with the featuredigittimeout, but I never could quite decide

	  had issues. If "iax2 prune realtime all" was called, it would

	  happened. This is because the reload that was supposed to take
	  place checks the config files, sees no changes, and does nothing.
	  If there had been a change in the the config file, the realtime
	  users would have been marked for deletion and everything would
	  have been fine. Now prune_users() and prune_peers() are called
	  instead of reload_config() to prune all users/peers that are
	  realtime. These functions remove all users/peers with the
	  rtfriend and delme flags set. iax2_prune_realtime() also lacked
	  the code to properly delete a single friend. For example. if iax2
	  prune realtime <friend> was called, only the peer instance would
	  be removed. The user would still remain. (closes issue #14479)

	  34 lines This patch fixes a regression of sorts that was
	  introduced in rev 24425. It basically fixes AST-190/ABE-1782.
	  What was wrong: the user has 6000 extensions in one context; and
	  then 6000 contexts, one per extension. The parser could only
	  handle about 4893 of the 6000 extens in the single context. This
	  was due to the regression I mentioned. To get rid of shift/reduce
	  conflicts, Luigi set up right-recursive lists for globals,
	  context elements, switch lists, and statements. Right recursive
	  lists got rid of the warnings, but instead, they use up a
	  tremendous amount of stack space when the lists are long. I saw
	  this a few years back, and resolved not to fix it until someone
	  complained. That day has arrived! After the changes were made, I
	  ran the regression test suite, and there were no problems. I took
	  the test case the user provided, and added 100,000 extensions to
	  the single context, that already had 6,000 extens in it. (I'll
	  see your 6, and raise you 100!) It takes a few minutes to read it
	  all in, check it and generate code for it, but no problems. So, I
	  think I can say that fundamentally, there are no longer any
	  limits on the number of items you can place in contexts,
	  statement blocks, switches, or globals, beyond your virt mem
	  constraints. ........

	* main/features.c: Locking issue in action_bridge and bridge_exec
	  action_bridge() and bridge_exec() both search for the channels to
	  bridge to, and then immediately drop the lock. Instead, they
	  should hold the lock until the masquerade is complete. This will
	  guarantee the channel remains and prevent any other weirdness
	  from occurring. In action_bridge() some more weirdness comes into
	  play. Both channels are needlessly locked at the same time and
	  perform the exact same logic. It makes sense from a coding
	  organizational standpoint, but could cause a theoretical deadlock
	  so I split the code up. There is an issue associated with this,
	  but since its a rather complicated thing to reproduce I'm not
	  certain this alone will close it. issue# 14296 Review:

	* main/pbx.c: This patch fixes merge_contexts_and_delete so it does
	  not deadlock when hints are present. Reason: when I re-engineered
	  the merge_and_delete func to reduce its lock time, I failed to
	  notice that the functions it calls still also do locking as
	  before. This leads to deadlocks on dialplan reloads, when there
	  are actually living, subscribed hints registered in the system.
	  While the reporter come across this problem while using AEL, I
	  might note that these deadlocks should also happen if
	  extensions.conf were used. Here I added these routines to pbx.c:
	  ast_add_extension_nolock add_pri_lockopt
	  ast_add_extension2_lockopt find_context add_hint_nolock All of
	  the above routines are static and restricted to be used only
	  within pbx.c, and more specifically within the
	  merge_contexts_and_delete routine. They are pretty much the same
	  as their counterparts except they don't lock contexts or hints.
	  Most of them now do the real work of their name-alike, with
	  optional locking via extra arguments, and are called by their
	  name-alike. The goal was to have the original functions so they
	  would behave exactly as before. Both PJ and I tested these fixes,
	  and the deadlocking problem is no longer encountered. (closes

	* channels/chan_sip.c: T38 faxdetect should jump to the 'fax'
	  extension for incoming calls only The previous implementation of
	  T38 faxdetect resulted in both sides of the call jumping to a fax
	  extension when both sides had 't38pt_udptl=yes' and
	  'faxdetect=yes' in sip.conf and a 'fax' extension in the current
	  context. This revision will jump to a 'fax' extension on incoming
	  calls only.

	  on the svn/asterisk/team/sruffell/asterisk-trunk-transcoder
	  branch. codec_dahdi.c now always uses signed linear as the simple
	  codec so that a soft g729 codec will not end up being preferred
	  to the hardware codec. There are also changes to allow
	  codec_dahdi.c to feed packets to the hardware in the native
	  sample size of the codec. This solves problems with choppy audio
	  when using G723.

	  | 17 lines Modify bridging to properly evaluate DTMF after first
	  warning is played The main problem is currently if the Dial flag
	  L is used with a warning sound, DTMF is not evaluated after the
	  first warning sound. To fix this, a flag has been added in
	  ast_generic_bridge for playing the warning which ensures that if
	  a scheduled warning is missed, multiple warrnings are not played
	  back (due to a feature evaluation or waiting for digits).
	  ast_channel_bridge was modified to store the nexteventts in the
	  ast_bridge_config structure as that information was lost every
	  time ast_channel_bridge was reentered, causing a hangup due to
	  incorrect time calculations. (closes issue #14315) Reported by:

	* channels/chan_sip.c: create a UDPTL structure in
	  create_addr_from_peer() if it does not already exist for T38 This
	  is required to create a UDPTL structure in
	  create_addr_from_peer() to handle the scenario where
	  't38pt_udptl=yes' is not defined in the [general] section of

	  by enabling t38pt_udptl in the [general] section on one system
	  and only enabling t38pt_udptl in a peer's context on the system
	  sending a fax. Without the patch, the sending system will fail to
	  initiate T38 negotiation with the warning message, "No way to add
	  SDP without an UDPTL structure". When this patch is applied the
	  sending side will successfully initiate T38 negotiation.

	  includes a number of changes to the indications API. The primary
	  motivation for this work was to improve stability. The object
	  management in this API was significantly flawed, and a number of
	  trivial situations could cause crashes. The changes included are:
	  1) Remove the module res_indications. This included the critical
	  functionality that actually loaded the indications configuration.
	  I have seen many people have Asterisk problems because they
	  accidentally did not have an indications.conf present and loaded.
	  Now, this code is in the core, and Asterisk will fail to start
	  without indications configuration. There was one part of
	  res_indications, the dialplan applications, which did belong in a
	  module, and have been moved to a new module, app_playtones. 2)
	  Object management has been significantly changed. Tone zones are
	  now managed using astobj2, and it is no longer possible to crash
	  Asterisk by issuing a reload that destroys tone zones while they
	  are in use. 3) The API documentation has been filled out. 4) The
	  API has been updated to follow our naming conventions. 5) Various
	  bits of code throughout the tree have been updated to account for
	  the API update. 6) Configuration parsing has been mostly
	  re-written. 7) "Code cleanup" The code is from
	  svn/asterisk/team/russell/indications/. Review:

	  formats/format_siren7.c (added): Add basic (passthrough,
	  playback, record) support for ITU G.722.1 and G.722.1C (also
	  known as Siren7 and Siren14) This patch adds passthrough, file
	  recording and file playback support for the codecs listed above,
	  with negotiation over SIP/SDP supported. Due to Asterisk's
	  current limitation of treating a codec/bitrate combination as a
	  unique codec, only G.722.1 at 32 kbps and G.722.1C at 48 kbps are
	  supported. Along the way, some related work was done: 1) The
	  rtpPayloadType structure definition, used as a return result for
	  an API call in rtp.h, was moved from rtp.c to rtp.h so that the
	  API call was actually usable. The only previous used of the API
	  all was chan_h323.c, which had a duplicate of the structure
	  definition instead of doing it the right way. 2) The hardcoded
	  SDP sample rates for various codecs in chan_sip.c were removed,
	  in favor of storing these sample rates in rtp.c along with the
	  codec definitions there. A new API call was added to allow
	  retrieval of the sample rate for a given codec. 3) Some basic
	  'a=fmtp' parsing for SDP was added to chan_sip, because chan_sip
	  *must* decline any media streams offered for these codecs that
	  are not at the bitrates that we support (otherwise Bad Things
	  (TM) would result). Review: http://reviewboard.digium.com/r/158/

	  | 27 lines Don't send DTMF for infinite time if we do not receive
	  an END event. I thought that this was going to end up being a
	  pretty gnarly fix, but it turns out that there was actually
	  already a configuration option in rtp.conf, dtmftimeout, that was
	  intended to handle this situation. However, in between Asterisk
	  1.2 and Asterisk 1.4, the code that processed the option got
	  lost. So, this commit brings it back to life. The default timeout
	  is 3 seconds. However, it is worth noting that having this be
	  configurable at all is not really the recommended behavior in RFC
	  2833. From Section 3.5 of RFC 2833: Limiting the time period of
	  extending the tone is necessary to avoid that a tone "gets
	  stuck". Regardless of the algorithm used, the tone SHOULD NOT be
	  extended by more than three packet interarrival times. A slight
	  extension of tone durations and shortening of pauses is generally
	  harmless. Three seconds will pretty much _always_ be far more
	  than three packet interarrival times. However, that behavior is
	  not required, so I'm going to leave it with our legacy behavior
	  for now. Code from svn/asterisk/team/russell/issue_14460 (closes

	  'd' option would not work for channel types which use RTP to
	  transport DTMF digits. The only way to allow for this to work was
	  to answer the channel if we saw that this option was enabled. I
	  realized that this may cause issues with CDRs, specifically with
	  giving false dispositions and answer times. I therefore modified
	  ast_answer to take another parameter which would tell if the CDR
	  should be marked answered. I also extended this to the Answer
	  application so that the channel may be answered but not CDRified
	  if desired. I also modified app_dictate and app_waitforsilence to
	  only answer the channel if it is not already up, to help not
	  allow for faulty CDR answer times. All of these changes are going
	  into Asterisk trunk. For 1.6.0 and 1.6.1, however, all the
	  changes except for the change to the Answer application will go

	  becomes invalid due to masquerading or hanging up. app_mixmonitor
	  runs its own thread to monitor the channel's activity and write
	  the mixed audio to a file. Since this thread runs independently
	  of the channel, it is possible that the mixmonitor thread's
	  channel pointer will point to freed memory when the channel
	  either is masqueraded or hangs up (technically, both cases are
	  hangups, but we need to handle the cases slightly differently).
	  The solution for this is to employ a datastore, which has the
	  nice benefit of allowing us to hook into channel masquerades and
	  hangups and update our pointer as necessary. If this looks
	  familiar, this same technique is employed in app_chanspy.
	  app_chanspy is a bit more involved since it does a lot more
	  operations on the channel that is being spied upon.
	  app_mixmonitor does have an extra touch that app_chanspy doesn't
	  have, though. Since there is a thread race between the channel's
	  thread and the mixmonitor thread on a hangup, we em- ploy a
	  condition-and-boolean combination to ensure that the channel
	  thread finishes with our structure before the mixmonitor thread
	  attempts to free it. No crashes! (closes issue #14374) Reported

	  IAX2 transfer not handing off calls. Reverts changes in 116884
	  Fixes issue with IAX2 transfers not taking place. As it was, a
	  call that was being transfered would never be handed off
	  correctly to the call ends because of how call numbers were
	  stored in a hash table. The hash table, "iax_peercallno_pvt",
	  storing all the current call numbers did not take into account
	  the complications associated with transferring a call, so a
	  separate hash table was required. This second hash table
	  "iax_transfercallno_pvt" handles calls being transfered, once the
	  call transfer is complete the call is removed from the transfer
	  hash table and added to the peer hash table resuming normal
	  operations. Addition functions were created to handle storing,
	  removing, and comparing items in the iax_transfercallno_pvt
	  table. The changes reverted in 116884 caused backwards
	  compatibility issues involving iax2 transfer with 1.6.0, 1.4, and

	* main/file.c: Fix a problem where file playback would cause fds to
	  remain open forever The problem came from the fact that a frame
	  read from a format interpreter was not freed. Adding a call to
	  ast_frfree fixed this. The explanation for why this caused the
	  problem is a bit complex, but here goes: There was a problem in
	  all versions of Asterisk where the embedded frame of a filestream
	  structure was referenced after the filestream was freed. This was
	  fixed by adding reference counting to the filestream structure.
	  The refcount would increase every time that a filestream's frame
	  pointer was pointing to an actual frame of data. When the frame
	  was freed, the refcount would decrease. Once the refcount reached
	  0, the filestream was freed, and as part of the operation, the
	  open files were closed as well. Thus it becomes more clear why a
	  missing ast_frfree would cause a reference leak and cause the
	  files to not be closed. You may ask then if there was a frame
	  leak before this patch. The answer to that is actually no! The
	  filestream code was "smart" enough to know that since the frame
	  we received came from a format interpreter, the frame had no
	  malloced data and thus didn't need to be freed. Now, however,
	  there is cleanup that needs to be done when we finish with the
	  frame, so we do need to call ast_frfree on the frame to be sure
	  that the refcount for the filestream is decremented
	  appropriately. (closes issue #14384) Reported by: fiddur Patches:

	  include/asterisk/features.h: This change allows the disconnect
	  feature (as in "one-touch" in features.c) to be used within the
	  dial app, before a call is bridged. Many thanks to sobomax for
	  submitting this patch. Quoting from bug 11582: "So the goal of
	  the patch was to use the user configured feature code during the
	  call setup phase. The original ast_feature_interpret() function
	  is not well suited for this purpose as it uses much call bridge
	  specific data and doesn't separate a detection of feature from a
	  feature handler call. So a new function ast_feature_detect() has
	  been extracted off the ast_feature_interpret() function but
	  keeping the original logic intact except some insignificant
	  changes to locking. "Having created the ast_feature_detect()
	  function the possibility to use feature detection in almost any
	  place of the asterisk code. So a call to this function has been
	  added to wait_for_answer() function of app_dial.so module. This
	  code doesn't call the feature handler however and uses old call
	  leg disconnect logic to make the changes as small and simple as
	  possible to prevent unexpected problems. A disconnect feature
	  currently is the only one supported during call setup as other
	  features as call parking and call transfer don't make much sense
	  during call setup. However if need in some of the features would
	  arise it is much easier to implement as the infrastructure
	  changes are already in place with this patch." I have cleaned up
	  the patch somewhat, and verified that the existing functionality
	  is not harmed, and that the new functionality works. Terry has
	  committed his stuff, and there were no conflicts (see 14274).

	  | 37 lines Fix feature inheritance with builtin features When
	  using builtin features like parking and transfers, the
	  AST_FEATURE_* flags would not be set correctly for all instances
	  when either performing a builtin attended transfer, or parking a
	  call and getting the timeout callback. Also, there was no way on
	  a per-call basis to specify what features someone should have on
	  picking up a parked call (since that doesn't involve the Dial()
	  command). There was a global option for setting whether or not
	  all users who pickup a parked call should have
	  AST_FEATURE_REDIRECT set, but nothing for DISCONNECT, AUTOMON, or
	  PARKCALL. This patch: 1) adds the BRIDGE_FEATURES dialplan
	  variable which can be set either in the dialplan or with setvar
	  in channels that support it. This variable can be set to any
	  combination of 't', 'k', 'w', and 'h' (case insensitive matching
	  of the equivalent dial options), to set what features should be
	  activated on this channel. The patch moves the setting of the
	  features datastores into the bridging code instead of app_dial to
	  help facilitate this. 2) adds global options parkedcallparking,
	  parkedcallhangup, and parkedcallrecording to be similar to the
	  parkedcalltransfers option for globally setting features. 3) has
	  builtin_atxfer call builtin_parkcall if being transfered to the

	  46 lines This patch fixes h-exten running misbehavior in
	  manager-redirected situations. What it does: 1. A new Flag value
	  is defined in include/asterisk/channel.h,
	  AST_FLAG_BRIDGE_HANGUP_DONT, which used as a messenge to the
	  bridge hangup exten code not to run the h-exten there (nor
	  publish the bridge cdr there). It will done at the pbx-loop level
	  instead. 2. In the manager Redirect code, I set this flag on the
	  channel if the channel has a non-null pbx pointer. I did the same
	  for the second (chan2) channel, which gets run if name2 is set...
	  and the first succeeds. 3. I restored the ending of the cdr for
	  the pbx loop h-exten running code. Don't know why it was removed
	  in the first place. 4. The first attempt at the fix for this bug
	  was to place code directly in the async_goto routine, which was
	  called from a large number of places, and could affect a large
	  number of cases, so I tested that fix against a fair number of
	  transfer scenarios, both with and without the patch. In the
	  process, I saw that putting the fix in async_goto seemed not to
	  affect any of the blind or attended scenarios, but still, I was
	  was highly concerned that some other scenarios I had not tested
	  might be negatively impacted, so I refined the patch to its
	  current scope, and jmls tested both. In the process, tho, I saw
	  that blind xfers in one situation, when the one-touch blind-xfer
	  feature is used by the peer, we got strange h-exten behavior. So,
	  I inserted code to swap CDRs and to set the HANGUP_DONT field, to
	  get uniform behavior. 5. I added code to the bridge to obey the
	  HANGUP_DONT flag, skipping both publishing the bridge CDR, and
	  running the h-exten; they will be done at the pbx-loop (higher)
	  level instead. 6. I removed all the debug logs from the patch
	  before committing. 7. I moved the AUTOLOOP set/reset in the
	  h-exten code in res_features so it's only done if the h-exten is
	  going to be run. A very minor performance improvement, but
	  technically correct. (closes issue #14241) Reported by: jmls

	  2009) | 39 lines Fix devicestate problems for "always-on" agent
	  channels A revision to chan_agent attempted to "inherit" the
	  device state of the underlying channel in order to report the
	  device state of an agent channel more accurately. The problem
	  with the logic here is that it makes no sense to use this for
	  always-on agents. If the agent is logged in, then to the
	  underlying channel, the agent will always appear to be "in use,"
	  no matter if the agent is on a call or not. The reason is that to
	  the underlying channel, the channel is currently in use on a call
	  to the AgentLogin application. The most common cause that I found
	  for this issue to occur was for a SIP channel to be the
	  underlying channel type for an Agent channel. If the SIP phone
	  re-registers, then the registration will cause the device state
	  core to query the device state of the SIP channel. Since the SIP
	  channel is in use, the Agent channel would also inherit this
	  status. Once the agent channel was set to "in use" there was no
	  way that the device state could change on that channel unless the
	  agent logged out. The solution for this problem is a bit
	  different in 1.4 than it is in the other branches. In 1.4, there
	  will be a one-line fix to make sure that only callback agents
	  will inherit device state from their underlying channel type. For
	  the other branches of Asterisk, since callback support has been
	  removed, there is also no need for device state inheritance in
	  chan_agent, so I will simply be removing it from the code. In
	  addition, the 1.4 source is getting a new comment to help the
	  next person who edits chan_agent.c. I'm adding a comment that a
	  agent_pvt's loginchan field may be used to determine if the agent
	  is a callback agent or not. (closes issue #14173) Reported by:

	  slinfactory used the "samples" field of an ast_frame in order to
	  determine the amount of data contained within the frame. In
	  certain cases, such as jitter buffer interpolated frames, the
	  frame would have a non-zero value for "samples" but have NULL
	  "data" This caused a problem when a memcpy call in
	  ast_slinfactory_read would attempt to access invalid memory. The
	  solution in use here is to never feed frames into the slinfactory
	  if they have NULL "data" (closes issue #13116) Reported by:

	* apps/app_queue.c: Fix queue crashes that would occur after the
	  calling channel was masqueraded. The data passed to the
	  end_bridge_callback was assumed to be data which was still
	  stack'd. The problem was that with some call features, attended
	  transfers in particular, a new bridge thread is started once the
	  feature completes, meaning that when the end_bridge_callback is
	  called, the end_bridge_callback_data was invalid. To fix this
	  problem, there are two measures taken 1. Instead of pointing to
	  stacked data, we now used heap-allocated data for passing to the
	  end_bridge_callback in app_queue 2. Since bridges can end
	  multiple times on a single logical call, we wait until the final
	  bridge is broken to actually set any queue variables. This is
	  accomplished through reference-counting and the use of an
	  end_bridge_callback_data_fixup function in app_queue.c (closes

	  2009) | 28 lines Fix broken call pickup There was a subtle change
	  in ast_do_masquerade which resulted in failed attempts to pickup
	  calls. The problem was that the value of the AST_FLAG_OUTGOING
	  flag was copied from the clone to the original channel. In the
	  case of call pickup, this meant that the AST_FLAG_OUTGOING flag
	  ended up being cleared on the channel that was attempting to
	  execute the pickup. Because this flag was not set, when ast_read
	  came across an answer frame, it ignored it. The result of this
	  was that the calling channel was never properly answered. This
	  fix changes the behavior in ast_do_masquerade to set the flags on
	  the original channel to the union of the flags on the clone
	  channel. This way, if the AST_FLAG_OUTGOING flag is set on either
	  of the two channels involved in the masquerade, the resulting
	  channel will have the flag set as well. (closes issue #14206)

	  a "user" and a "peer" but the logic would not allow "friends" to
	  show up as "peers" since onlymatchonip was set to FALSE for
	  friends. I have modified the sip_peer structure to more

	* apps/app_queue.c: Fix device state parsing issues for channel
	  names with multiple slashes The fix being applied is a bit
	  different for trunk and the 1.6.X branches. For trunk, we only
	  wish to strip off the characters beyond the second slash if the
	  channel is a Local channel (i.e. we are removing the /n from the
	  device name). Other channel technologies with multiple slashes
	  (e.g. DAHDI) need the information after the second slash in order
	  to get the proper device state information. In addition to this
	  fix, the 1.6.X branches are receiving a much more important fix
	  as well. The problem in 1.6.X is that the member's device name
	  was being directly changed instead of having a copy changed. This
	  meant that we would strip off the second slash and trailing
	  characters and then leave the member's device name like that
	  permanently thereafter. (closes issue #14014) Reported by:

	  makes such pointers used in chan_sip.c instead be offsets from
	  the beginning of the string so that the same math may be applied
	  no matter where in memory the string resides. To help ease this
	  transition, a macro called REQ_OFFSET_TO_STR has been added to
	  chan_sip.c so that given a sip_request and an offset, the string
	  at that offset is returned. (closes issue #14220) Reported by:

	* res/res_timing_timerfd.c: Fix a logic error that occur when using
	  the timerfd interface This sequence of events posed a problem
	  timerfd_timer_open timerfd_timer_enable_continuous
	  timerfd_timer_set_rate timerfd_timer_disable_continuous The
	  reason was that the timing module was written under the
	  assumption that timerfd_timer_set_rate would not be called
	  between enabling and disabling continuous mode. What happened in
	  this situation was that timerfd_timer_enable_continuous saved off
	  our previously set timer (in this situation a 0 timer, meaning it
	  never runs out). Then timerfd_timer_disable_continuous would
	  restore this 0 timer, even though it logically should set the
	  timer to be whatever was set in timerfd_timer_set_rate. Now the
	  behavior in timerfd_timer_set_rate is to overwrite the saved
	  timer that may or may not have been set in
	  timerfd_timer_enable_continuous. Even if
	  timerfd_timer_enable_continuous has not been previously called,
	  this will not harm the operation. Thanks to Terry Wilson for
	  discovering the problem and giving me a really great debug
	  capture that pointed out the problem clearly

	  14 lines This patch fixes a problem where a goto (or jump, in
	  this case) fails a consistency check because it can't find a
	  matching extension. The problem was a missing instruction to end
	  the range notation in the code where it converts the pattern into
	  a regex and uses the regex code to determine the match. I tested
	  using the AEL code the user supplied, and now, the consistency

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Add missing brace

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix the compactheaders option in sip.conf

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Remove an unneeded condition for line
	  addition to a SIP request/response In Asterisk 1.4 and 1.6.0, the
	  sip_request structure had a statically allocated buffer to hold
	  the text of the request. There was a check in the add_line
	  function to not attempt to write the line into the buffer if we
	  did not have room for it. In trunk and Asterisk versions starting
	  with 1.6.1, an expandable ast_str structure is used to hold the
	  text. Since it may grow to fit an arbitrarily sized string, this
	  check in add_line is no longer valid. I found this oddity while
	  attempting to fix issue #14220; however, I do not believe that
	  this is the fix for that issue since the output supplied by the
	  reporter did not contain the warning message that would be
	  printed had this condition been satisfied.

	  | 20 lines Don't overflow when paging more than 128 extensions
	  The number of available slots for calls in app_page was hardcoded
	  to 128. Proper bounds checking was not in place to enforce this
	  limit, so if more than 128 extensions were passed to the Page()
	  app, Asterisk would crash. This patch instead dynamically
	  allocates memory for the ast_dial structures and removes the
	  (non-functional) arbitrary limit. This issue would have special
	  importance to anyone who is dynamically creating the argument
	  passed to the Page application and allowing more than 128
	  extensions to be added by an outside user via some external
	  interface. The patch posted by a_villacis was slightly modified
	  for some coding guidelines and other cleanups. Thanks,

	  2009) | 41 lines A couple of changes to T.38 SDP attribute
	  handling There are some boolean attributes for T.38 such as
	  T38FaxFillBitRemoval, T38FaxTranscodingMMR, and
	  T38FaxTranscodingJBIG. By simply being present, we should treat
	  these as a "true" value. The current code, however, was requiring
	  a 1 or 0 as the value of the attribute in order to parse it. This
	  is due to the fact that there are some T.38 endpoints and
	  gateways that also transmit this information incorrectly. This
	  patch follows the "be liberal in what you accept and strict in
	  what you send" philosophy by accepting both the correctly- and
	  incorrectly-formatted attributes, but only sending information as
	  it is supposed to be sent. It was also discovered that a
	  particular type of T.38 gateway sends some non-standard T.38 SDP
	  attributes. Instead of using T38FaxMaxDatagram and T38MaxBitRate,
	  it used T38MaxDatagram and T38FaxMaxRate respectively. We now
	  will properly accept these attributes as well. Note that there
	  are a lot of patches cited in the below commit message template.
	  This is because the person who submitted these patches is an
	  awesome person and wrote 1.4, 1.6.0, and 1.6.1 variants. (closes

	  app_dial's similar changes made last week. I also took the

	* channels/chan_sip.c: There is no section 22.2.2 in rfc 3261. I
	  believe 26.2.2 is what was meant: Note that in the SIPS URI

	  "sips:alice@atlanta.com;transport=tcp" and
	  "sips:alice@atlanta.com;transport=sctp" are both valid (although
	  note that UDP is not a valid transport for SIPS). The use of
	  "transport=tls" has consequently been deprecated, partly because
	  it was specific to a single hop of the request. This is a change
	  since RFC 2543.

	  131 lines This merges the masqpark branch into 1.4 These changes
	  eliminate the need for (and use of) the KEEPALIVE return code in
	  res_features.c; There are other places that use this result code
	  for similar purposes at a higher level, these appear to be left
	  alone in 1.4, but attacked in trunk. The reason these changes are
	  being made in 1.4, is that parking ends a channel's life, in some
	  situations, and the code in the bridge (and some other places),
	  was not checking the result code properly, and dereferencing the
	  channel pointer, which could lead to memory corruption and
	  crashes. Calling the masq_park function eliminates this danger in
	  higher levels. A series of previous commits have replaced some
	  parking calls with masq_park, but this patch puts them ALL to
	  rest, (except one, purposely left alone because a masquerade is
	  done anyway), and gets rid of the code that tests the KEEPALIVE
	  result, and the NOHANGUP_PEER result codes. While bug 13820
	  inspired this work, this patch does not solve all the problems
	  mentioned there. I have tested this patch (again) to make sure I
	  have not introduced regressions. Crashes that occurred when a
	  parked party hung up while the parking party was listening to the
	  numbers of the parking stall being assigned, is eliminated. These
	  are the cases where parking code may be activated: 1. Feature one
	  touch (eg. *3) 2. Feature blind xfer to parking lot (eg ##700) 3.
	  Run Park() app from dialplan (eg sip xfer to 700) (eg. dahdi
	  hookflash xfer to 700) 4. Run Park via manager. The interesting
	  testing cases for parking are: I. A calls B, A parks B a. B hangs
	  up while A is getting the numbers announced. b. B hangs up after
	  A gets the announcement, but before the parking time expires c. B
	  waits, time expires, A is redialed, A answers, B and A are
	  connected, after which, B hangs up. d. C picks up B while still
	  in parking lot. II. A calls B, B parks A a. A hangs up while B is
	  getting the numbers announced. b. A hangs up after B gets the
	  announcement, but before the parking time expires c. A waits,
	  time expires, B is redialed, B answers, A and B are connected,
	  after which, A hangs up. d. C picks up A while still in parking
	  lot. Testing this throroughly involves acting all the
	  permutations of I and II, in situations 1,2,3, and 4. Since I
	  added a few more changes (ALL references to KEEPALIVE in the
	  bridge code eliimated (I missed one earlier), I retested most of
	  the above cases, and no crashes. H-extension weirdness. Current
	  h-extension execution is not completely correct for several of
	  the cases. For the case where A calls B, and A parks B, the 'h'
	  exten is run on A's channel as soon as the park is accomplished.
	  This is expected behavior. But when A calls B, and B parks A,
	  this will be current behavior: After B parks A, B is hung up by
	  the system, and the 'h' (hangup) exten gets run, but the channel
	  mentioned will be a derivative of A's... Thus, if A is DAHDI/1,
	  and B is DAHDI/2, the h-extension will be run on channel
	  Parked/DAHDI/1-1<ZOMBIE>, and the start/answer/end info will be
	  those relating to Channel A. And, in the case where A is
	  reconnected to B after the park time expires, when both parties
	  hang up after the joyful reunion, no h-exten will be run at all.
	  In the case where C picks up A from the parking lot, when either
	  A or C hang up, the h-exten will be run for the C channel. CDR's
	  are a separate issue, and not addressed here. As to WHY this
	  strange behavior occurs, the answer lies in the procedure
	  followed to accomplish handing over the channel to the parking
	  manager thread. This procedure is called masquerading. In the
	  process, a duplicate copy of the channel is created, and most of
	  the active data is given to the new copy. The original channel
	  gets its name changed to XXX<ZOMBIE> and keeps the PBX
	  information for the sake of the original thread (preserving its
	  role as a call originator, if it had this role to begin with),
	  while the new channel is without this info and becomes a call
	  target (a "peer"). In this case, the parking lot manager thread
	  is handed the new (masqueraded) channel. It will not run an
	  h-exten on the channel if it hangs up while in the parking lot.
	  The h exten will be run on the original channel instead, in the
	  original thread, after the bridge completes. See bug 13820 for
	  our intentions as to how to clean up the h exten behavior.

	  22 Dec 2008) | 36 lines Fix a deadlock relating to channel locks
	  and autoservice It has been discovered that if a channel is
	  locked prior to a call to ast_autoservice_stop, then it is likely
	  that a deadlock will occur. The reason is that the call to
	  ast_autoservice_stop has a check built into it to be sure that
	  the thread running autoservice is not currently trying to
	  manipulate the channel we are about to pull out of autoservice.
	  The autoservice thread, however, cannot advance beyond where it
	  currently is, though, because it is trying to acquire the lock of
	  the channel for which autoservice is attempting to be stopped.
	  The gist of all this is that a channel MUST NOT be locked when
	  attempting to stop autoservice on the channel. In this particular
	  case, the channel was locked by a call to ast_read. A call to
	  ast_exists_extension led to autoservice being started and stopped
	  due to the existence of dialplan switches. It may be that there
	  are future commits which handle the same symptoms but in a
	  different location, but based on my looks through the code, it is
	  very rare to see a construct such as this one. (closes issue

	* res/res_agi.c: Remove AST_PBX_KEEPALIVE usage from res_agi. This
	  patch removes the usage of AST_PBX_KEEPALIVE from res_agi. The
	  only usage was for the AGI command, "asyncagi break". This patch
	  removes this feature. Normally, a feature would not be removed
	  like this. However, this code is broken and usage of it will
	  result in a memory leak. Usage of this feature will make the AGI
	  code return a result of AST_PBX_KEEPALIVE. The PBX handler
	  assumes that another thread has assumed ownership of the channel.
	  The channel thread will exit without destroying the channel.
	  Unfortunately, _no_ thread has ownership of the channel at this
	  point. There are a couple of serious problems here: 1) The only
	  way to recover the caller is to issue a channel redirect. This
	  will work, but this will be done with a masquerade, and the old
	  ast_channel structure will be lost. 2) Until the channel redirect
	  happens, there is no code servicing the channel. That means
	  nothing is reading audio or handling events coming from the
	  channel. This is very bad. The recommended way to get this same
	  "break" functionality is to issue the redirect while the channel
	  is still being handled by the AGI code. That way, there will be
	  no memory leak, and there will be no period of time that the
	  channel is not being serviced.

	  Prior to the addition of this functionality, if a channel running
	  MixMonitor was transferred by another party, then the recording
	  would stop once the transfer had completed. By using
	  AUDIOHOOK_INHERIT, you can make MixMonitor continue recording the
	  call even after the transfer has completed. It has also been

	* channels/chan_sip.c, configs/sip.conf.sample, CHANGES: This patch
	  adds a new 'ignoresdpversion' option to sip.conf. When this is
	  enabled (either globally or for a specific peer), chan_sip will
	  treat any SDP data it receives as new data and update the media
	  stream accordingly. By default, Asterisk will only modify the
	  media stream if the SDP session version received is different
	  from the current SDP session version. This option is required to
	  interoperate with devices that have non-standard SDP session
	  version implementations (observed by toc on the bug tracker with
	  Microsoft OCS which always uses 0 as the session version).

	* main/pbx.c: (closes issue #14076) Reported by: toc Tested by:
	  murf OK, Well this issue has had its share of flip-flopping. I
	  found the following: 1. the code in question, in ext_cmp1 in
	  pbx.c, would not allow two extensions that vary only by any
	  dashes contained within them, to be defined in the same context.
	  2. for input dialstrings, dashes are NOT ignored. So, skipping
	  them when sorting patterns seemed a bit silly. Thus, you might
	  declare ext 891 in a context, but if you try dialing 8-9-1, it
	  will NOT match 891. So, I proposed to remove the code from
	  ext_cmp1 to skip the spaces and dashes. Just kept us from
	  declaring 891 and 8-9-1 in the same context, forcing users to
	  generate otherwise uselessly obfuscated dialplan code to get the
	  same effect. Then, I tried out 1.4, and found that: 1. you can
	  declare 891 and 8-9-1 in the same context! 2. You can't define
	  891, and have 8-9-1 match it! Nor can you define 8-9-1, and have
	  891 match it! So, it appears that my proposal simply restores the
	  pbx to behaving as it did in 1.4.

	  | 31 lines Handle a case where a call can be bridged to a channel
	  that is still ringing. The issue that was reported was about a
	  case where a RINGING channel got redirected to an extension to
	  pick up a call from parking. Once the parked call got taken out
	  of parking, it heard silence until the other side answered.
	  Ideally, the caller that was parked would get a ringing
	  indication. This patch fixes this case so that the caller
	  receives ringback once it comes out of parking until the other
	  side answers. The fixes are: - Make sure we remember that a
	  channel was an outgoing channel when doing a masquerade. This
	  prevents an erroneous ast_answer() call on the channel, which
	  causes a bogus 200 OK to be sent in the case of SIP. - Add some
	  additional comments to explain related parts of code. - Update
	  the handling of the ast_channel visible_indication field. Storing
	  values that are not stateful is pointless. Control frames that
	  are events or commands should be ignored. - When a bridge first
	  starts, check to see if the peer channel needs to be given
	  ringing indication because the calling side is still ringing. -
	  Rework ast_indicate_data() a bit for the sake of readability.

	  processed out of order. These changes come from
	  team/russell/issue_12658 1) Change autoservice to put digits on
	  the head of the channel's frame readq instead of the tail. If
	  there were frames on the readq that autoservice had not yet read,
	  the previous code would have resulted in out of order processing.
	  This required a new API call to queue a frame to the head of the
	  queue instead of the tail. 2) Change up the processing of DTMF in
	  ast_read(). Some of the problems were the result of having two
	  sources of pending DTMF frames. There was the dtmfq and the more
	  generic readq. Both were used for pending DTMF in various
	  scenarios. Simplifying things to only use the frame readq avoids
	  some of the problems. 3) Fix a bug where a DTMF END frame could
	  get passed through when it shouldn't have. If code set
	  END_DTMF_ONLY in the middle of digit emulation, and a digit
	  arrived before emulation was complete, digits would get processed
	  out of order. (closes issue #12658) Reported by: dimas Tested by:

	* main/channel.c: Fix the "failed" extension for outgoing calls.
	  The conversion to use ast_check_hangup() everywhere instead of

	  NULL. Unfortunately, this will be NULL is some valid
	  circumstances, such as with a dummy channel. The fix is simple.
	  Don't check tech_pvt. It's pointless, because the code path that
	  sets this to NULL is when the channel hangup callback gets
	  called. This happens inside of ast_hangup(), which is the same
	  function responsible for freeing the channel. Any code calling
	  ast_check_hangup() better not be calling it after that point, and
	  if so, we have a bigger problem at hand. (closes issue #14035)

	  murf This crash was the result of a few small errors that would
	  combine in 64-bit land to result in a crash. 32-bit land might
	  have seen these combine to mysteriously drop the args to an
	  application call, in certain circumstances. Also, in trying to
	  find this bug, I spotted a situation in the flex input, where, in
	  passing back a 'word' to the parser, it would allocate a buffer
	  larger than necessary. I changed the usage in such situations, so
	  that strdup was not used, but rather, an ast_malloc, followed by
	  ast_copy_string. I removed a field from the pval struct, in u2,
	  that was never getting used, and set in one spot in the code. I
	  believe it was an artifact of a previous fix to make switch cases
	  work invisibly with extens. And, for goto's I removed a '!' from
	  before a strcmp, that has been there since the initial merging of
	  AEL2, that might prevent the proper target of a goto from being
	  found. This was pretty harmless on its own, as it would just
	  louse up a consistency check for users. Many thanks to
	  ckjohnsonme for providing a simplified and complete set of
	  information about the bug, that helped considerably in finding
	  and fixing the problem. Now, to get aelparse up and running again
	  in trunk, and out of its "horribly broken" state, so I can run
	  the regression suite! ........

	  re-INVITE to place the call on hold greatly exceeded INT_MAX.
	  This also aligns with RFC 2327 better since it recommends using
	  an NTP timestamp for the version (which is a 64-bit number).

	  commit makes the choice a build-time decision, by only allowing
	  one of the timer interfaces to be chosen in menuselect. It would
	  be preferable if the choice could be made at run-time, however.
	  The preferred timing interface could be loaded and tested, and if
	  it does not work, choice number two may be used instead. That
	  sort of thing. That is beyond the scope of work in this branch
	  though.

	* UPGRADE.txt, include/asterisk/strings.h, apps/app_queue.c: Fix
	  some refcounting in app_queue.c and change the hashing used by
	  app_queue.c to be case-insensitive. This is accomplished by
	  adding a new case-insensitive hashing function. This was
	  necessary to prevent bad refcount errors (and potential crashes)
	  which would occur due to the fact that queues were initially read
	  from the config file in a case-sensitive manner. Then, when a
	  user issued a CLI command or manager action, we allowed for
	  case-insensitive input and used that input to directly try to
	  find the queue in the hash table. The result was either that we
	  could not find a queue that was input or worse, we would end up
	  hashing to a completely bogus value based on the input. This
	  commit resolves the problem presented in issue #13703. However,
	  that issue was reported against 1.6.0. Since this fix introduces
	  a behavior change, I am electing to not place this same fix in to
	  the 1.6.0 or 1.6.1 branches, and instead will opt for a change
	  which does not change behavior.

	  an announce_thread responsible for playing announcements to an
	  existing conference. This allows all announcing to be immediately
	  stopped if necessary but more importantly allows other threads
	  that need to play something to not block. There are multiple
	  benefits to this, but the actual bug is for solving the scenario
	  for a channel to be unusable after hang up for the entire
	  duration of the parting announcement. The parting announcement
	  can be extremely long depending on what the user recorded upon
	  joining the conference. Reviewed by Russell on Review Board:

	* main/channel.c, channels/chan_sip.c, include/asterisk/channel.h:
	  Introduce a new API call ast_channel_search_locked, which
	  iterates through the channel list calling a caller-defined
	  callback. The callback returns non-zero if a match is found. This
	  should speed up some of the code that I committed earlier today
	  in chan_sip (which is also updated by this commit). Reviewed by

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix the sip_peer reference count with
	  respect to scheduler entries for scheduling peer pokes, and
	  scheduling peer poke expirations.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix the sip_peer reference count with
	  respect to scheduler entries for registration expirations.

	* include/asterisk/sched.h: Fix a bug in AST_SCHED_REPLACE_UNREF().
	  The reference count of the object _must_ be increased before
	  creating the scheduler entry. Otherwise, you create a race
	  condition where the reference count may hit zero and the object
	  can disappear out from under you. This could also would have
	  incorrectly decreased the reference count in the case that the
	  scheduler add failed.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: I just noticed this construct and thought it
	  was silly to have a bunch of case statements with duplicated code
	  in each case. Instead, just use the built-in fallthrough
	  capability of case statements and reduce the code to a single
	  instance

2008-10-30 19:21 +0000 [r152875-152877]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Modify the documentation of the sip_registry
	  struct - Remove a comment that says that the monitor thread is
	  the only one that ever touches these objects. This is no longer
	  the case with TCP. Also, I would eventually like to get the
	  scheduler in its own thread, so this is just a poor assumption to
	  make. - Note that reference counting of these objects with
	  respect to scheduler entries is not complete. There are some
	  leaked references when deleting scheduler entries.

	* funcs/func_db.c: - spaces to tabs - add some braces - remove
	  unnecessary cast

	  14 lines A little documentation cross-ref between features and
	  dial and queue... I wasted some time (stupidly) trying to get the
	  one-touch parking stuff working, because it didn't occur to me
	  that I had to also have the corresponding options in the dial
	  command! Duh! (In all this time, I never set this up before!) So,
	  to keep some poor fool from suffering the same fate, I made the
	  features.conf.sample file mention the corresponding opts in
	  dial/queue; and the docs for dial/app specifically mention the
	  corresponding decls in the feature.conf file. I hope this doesn't
	  spoil some vast, eternal plan... ........

	  46 lines The magic trick to avoid this crash is not to try to
	  find the channel by name in the list, which is slow and resource
	  consuming, but rather to pay attention to the result codes from
	  the ast_bridge_call, to which I added the
	  AST_PBX_NO_HANGUP_PEER_PARKED value, which now are returned when
	  a channel is parked. Why? because CDR's aren't generated via
	  parking, so nothing is needed, but if a transfer occurred, there
	  are critical things I need. If you get AST_PBX_KEEPALIVE, then
	  don't touch the channel pointer. If you get
	  AST_PBX_NO_HANGUP_PEER, or AST_PBX_NO_HANGUP_PEER_PARKED, then
	  don't touch the peer pointer. Updated the several places where
	  the results from a bridge were not being properly obeyed, and
	  fixed some code I had introduced so that the results of the
	  bridge were not overridden (in trunk). All the places that
	  previously tested for AST_PBX_NO_HANGUP_PEER now have to check
	  for both AST_PBX_NO_HANGUP_PEER and
	  AST_PBX_NO_HANGUP_PEER_PARKED. I tested this against the 4 common
	  parking scenarios: 1. A calls B; B answers; A parks B; B hangs up
	  while A is getting the parking slot announcement, immediately
	  after being put on hold. 2. A calls B; B answers; A parks B; B
	  hangs up after A has been hung up, but before the park times out.
	  3. A calls B; B answers; B parks A; A hangs up while B is getting
	  the parking slot announcement, immediately after being put on
	  hold. 4. A calls B; B answers; B parks A; A hangs up after B has
	  been hung up, but before the park times out. No crash. I also ran
	  the scenarios above against valgrind, and accesses looked good.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: After a long discussion on #asterisk-bugs,
	  it seems kind of odd that a channel would be named after the
	  originating port. For endpoints that always include ":5060" as
	  part of the From: header, it will mean that you have a ton of
	  channels with names like "SIP/5060-3ea38a8b." I am boldly moving
	  forward with this change in trunk, but I'm not touching other
	  branches with this one since this definitely would qualify as a
	  behavior change. If there is a problem with this commit, and I
	  haven't seen the obvious reason why you'd want to name the
	  channel after the port from which the call originated, then
	  please feel free to revert this

	* main/pbx.c: Hmmm. Nobody (but me) is interested in seeing the
	  trie info when they do 'dialplan show ...' (even with debug set

	  added an extension_exists() call to make sure the trie info is
	  built. I moved the explanatory header to above the extension loop
	  to ensure it only prints once. And it will do this now, whether
	  debug is set or not. I removed the trie printing from the

	  to masquerade the channel if the channel that was to be parked
	  was running a PBX on it. The PBX thread can then maintain full
	  control of the channel (the zombie) as it expects to while
	  allowing the parking thread full control of the real (parked)
	  channel. 2) r143270: Changed park_call_full to hold the
	  parkinglot lock a little longer, which protects the parkeduser
	  struct from being freed out from underneath. Made sure that the
	  parking extension is added to the parking context while holding
	  the lock thereby ensuring that there are no spurious warnings
	  from removal attempts when a hangup occurs while the parking lot
	  is being announced. 3) r143475: (the one liner) compare peer and
	  chan instead of looking at the parked user (pu), which could have
	  possibly already have been freed by the parking thread

	* main/features.c: fix some comment placement

	* main/features.c: Explicitly set args in park_call_exec NULL so in
	  the case of no options being passed in, there is no garbage
	  attempted to be used. Also, do not set args to unknown value
	  again if there are no options passed in.

	* main/features.c: Okay, this should really do it now. While I did
	  manage to fix blind transfers with my last commit here, I also
	  caused an unwanted side-effect. That is, only the first priority
	  of the 'h' extension would be executed when a blind transfer
	  occurred instead of all priorities. Essentially, my last commit
	  corrected the return value of ast_bridge_call. However, the
	  implementation still was not 100% correct. Now it is.

	* main/features.c: if (!(x) == 0) is the same as if (x).

	* main/features.c: The logic surrounding the return value of
	  ast_spawn_extension within ast_bridge_call was reversed. This
	  problem was observed when a blind transfer placed from the callee
	  channel of a test call failed. While the problem I am solving
	  here is exactly the same as what was reported in issue #13584,
	  the difference is that this fix I am applying is trunk-only.
	  Issue #13584 was reported against the 1.4 branch, and my tests of
	  1.4's blind transfers appear to work fine.

	  edantie, DougUDI This crash happens because we are unsafely
	  handling old pointers. The channel whose cdr is being handled,
	  has been hung up and destroyed already. I reorganized the code a
	  bit, and tried not to lose the fork-cdr-chain concepts of the
	  previous code. I now verify that the 'previous' channel (the
	  channel we had when the bridge was started), still exists, by
	  looking it up by name in the channel list. I also do not try to
	  reset the CDR's of channels involved in bridges. Testing shows it
	  solves the crash problem, and should not negatively impact
	  previous fixes involving CDR's generated during/after blind
	  transfers. (The reason we need to reset the CDR's on the
	  "beginning" channels in the first place). ........

	  29 lines Tested by: sergee, murf, chris-mac, andrew, KNK This is
	  a "second attempt" to restore the previous "endbeforeh" behavior
	  in 1.4 and up. In order to capture information concerning all the
	  legs of transfers in all their infinite combinations, I was
	  forced to this particular solution by a chain of logical
	  necessities, the first being that I was not allowed to rewrite
	  the CDR mechanism from the ground up! This change basically
	  leaves the original machinery alone, which allows IVR and local
	  channel type situations to generate CDR's as normal, but a
	  channel flag can be set to suppress the normal running of the h
	  exten. That flag would be set by the code that runs the h exten
	  from the ast_bridge_call routine, to prevent the h exten from
	  being run twice. Also, a flag in the ast_bridge_config struct
	  passed into ast_bridge_call can be used to suppress the running
	  of the h exten in that routine. This would happen, for instance,
	  if you use the 'g' option in the Dial app. Running this routine
	  'early' allows not only the CDR() func to be used in the h
	  extension for reading CDR variables, but also allows them to be
	  modified before the CDR is posted to the backends. While I dearly
	  hope that this patch overcomes all problems, and introduces no
	  new problems, reality suggests that surely someone will have
	  problems. In this case, please re-open 13251 (or 13289), and
	  we'll see if we can't fix any remaining issues. ** trunk note:
	  some code to suppress the h exten being run from app_queue was
	  added; for the 'continue' option available only in trunk/1.6.x.

	  20 lines (closes issue #13364) Reported by: mdu113 Well,
	  fundamentally, the problems revealed in 13364 are because of the
	  ForkCDR call that is done before the dial. When the bridge is in
	  place, it's dealing with the first (and wrong) cdr in the list.
	  So, I wrote a little func to zip down to the first non-locked cdr
	  in the chain, and thru-out the ast_bridge_call, these results are
	  used instead of raw chan->cdr and peer->cdr pointers. This
	  shouldn't affect anyone who isn't forking cdrs before a dial, and
	  should correct the cdr's of those that do. So, this change ends
	  up correcting the dstchannel and userfield; the disposition was
	  fixed by a previous patch, it was OK coming into this problem.

	  30 lines (closes issue #12318) Reported by: krtorio I made a
	  small change to the code that handles local channel situations.
	  In that code, I copy the answer time from the peer cdr, to the
	  bridge_cdr, but I wasn't also copying the disposition from the
	  peer cdr. So, Now I copy the disposition, and I've tested against
	  these cases: 1. phone 1 never answers the phone; no cdr is
	  generated at all. this should show up as a manager command
	  failure or something. 2. phone 2 never answers. CDR is generated,
	  says NO ANSWER 3. phone 2 is busy. CDR is generated, says BUSY 4.
	  phone 2 answers: CDR is generated, times are correct; disposition
	  is ANSWERED, which is correct. The start time is the time that
	  the manager dialed the first phone. The answer time is the time
	  the second phone picks up. I purposely left the cid and src
	  fields blank; since this call really originates from the manager,
	  there is no 'easy' data to put in these fields. If you feel
	  strongly that these fields should be filled in, re-open this bug
	  and I'll dig further. ........

	* apps/app_queue.c: This is the trunk version of the patch to close
	  issue 12979. The difference between this and the 1.6.0 and 1.6.1
	  versions is that this is a much more invasive change. With this,
	  we completely get rid of the interfaces list, along with all its
	  helper functions. Let me take a moment to say that this change
	  personally excites me since it may mean huge steps forward
	  regarding proper lock order in app_queue without having to strew
	  seemingly unnecessary locks all over the place. It also results
	  in a huge reduction in lines of code and complexity. Way to go

	  instead of the peercapability. It seems that the intent of using

	  call to increase the chances of being able to native bridge the
	  channels. The problem is that if a codec were settled on for the
	  native bridge and that wasn't a codec that was configured to be
	  used by Asterisk for that peer, then Asterisk would send a

	  setting which could cause the caller to not join the queue or
	  exit the queue. Prior to this patch, we could potentially

	  modified the syntax in the usage, was wrong... - Pass

	  autocompletion on CLI commands (CLI_GENERATE). With this we avoid
	  comparisons on ast_cli_args->line like this: strcasestr(a->line,
	  " description") strcasestr(a->line, "descriptions ")
	  strcasestr(a->line, "realtime peer"), and so on.. Making the code
	  more confusing (check the spaces in description!). The only thing
	  we must be sure is to first check a->pos or a->argc. - Fix 'iax2
	  prune realtime' autocompletion, now we autocomplete this command
	  with 'all' & 'iax2 peers', check a look that iax2 peers where all
	  the peers, now only the ones in the cache.. (closes issue #13133)

	  (closes issue #13416) Reported by: yarns Tested by: murf If you
	  find this message overly verbose, relax, it's probably not meant
	  for you. This message is meant for probably only two people in
	  the whole world: me, or the poor schnook that has to maintain
	  this code because I'm either dead or unavailable at the moment.
	  This fix solves two reports, both having to do with embedding a
	  function call in a ${} construct. It was tricky because the
	  funccall syntax has parenthesis () in it. And up till now, the
	  'word' token in the flex stuff didn't allow that, because it
	  would tend to steal the LP and RP tokens. To be truthful, the
	  "word" token was the trickiest, most unstable thing in the whole
	  lexer. I was lucky it made this long without complaints. I had to
	  choose every character in the pattern with extreme care, and I
	  knew that someday I'd have to revisit it. Well, the day has come.
	  So, my brilliant idea (and I'm being modest), was to use the
	  surrounding ${} construct to make a state machine and capture
	  everything in it, no matter what it contains. But, I have to now
	  treat the word token like I did with comments, in that I turn the
	  whole thing into a state-machine sort of spec, with new contexts
	  "curlystate", "wordstate", and "brackstate". Wait a minute,
	  "brackstate"? Yes, well, it didn't take very many regression
	  tests to point out if I do this for ${} constructs, I also have
	  to do it with the $[] constructs, too. I had to create a separate
	  pcbstack2 and pcbstack3 because these constructs can occur inside
	  macro argument lists, and when we have two state machines
	  operating on the same structures we'd get problems otherwise. I
	  guess I could have stopped at pcbstack2 and had the brackstate
	  stuff share it, but it doesn't hurt to be safe. So, the pcbpush
	  and pcbpop routines also now have versions for "2" and "3". I had
	  to add the {KEYWORD} construct to the initial pattern for "word",
	  because previously word would match stuff like "default7",
	  because it was a longer match than the keyword "default". But,
	  not any more, because the word pattern only matches only one or
	  two characters now, and it will always lose. So, I made it the
	  winner again by making an optional match on any of the keywords
	  before it's normal pattern. I added another regression test to
	  make sure we don't lose this in future edits, and had to fix just
	  one regression, where it no longer reports a 'cascaded' error,
	  which I guess is a plus. I've given some thought as to whether to
	  apply these fixes to 1.4 and the 1.6.x releases, vs trunk; I
	  decided to put it in 1.4 because one of the bug reports was
	  against 1.4; and it is unexpected that AEL cannot handle this
	  situation. It actually reduced the amount of useless "cascade"
	  error messages that appeared in the regressions (by one line,
	  ehhem). There is a possible side-effect in that it does now do
	  more careful checking of what's in those ${} constructs, as far
	  as matching parens, and brackets are concerned. Some users may
	  find a an insidious problem and correct it this way. This should
	  be exceedingly rare, I hope. ........

	  non-evaluative Set(). This only usually happens if the user

	  2008) | 22 lines After working on the ao2_containers branch, I
	  noticed something a bit strange. In all cases where we provide a
	  callback function to ao2_container_alloc, the callback function
	  would only return 0 or CMP_MATCH. After inspecting the
	  ao2_callback() code carefully, I found that if you're only
	  looking for one specific item, then you should return CMP_MATCH |
	  CMP_STOP. Otherwise, astobj2 will continue traversing the current
	  bucket until the end searching for more matches. In cases like
	  chan_iax2 where in 1.4, all the peers are shoved into a single
	  bucket, this makes for potentially terrible performance since the
	  entire bucket will be traversed even if the peer is one of the
	  first ones come across in the bucket. All the changes I have made
	  were for cases where the callback function defined was passed to
	  ao2_container_alloc so that calls to ao2_find could find a unique
	  instance of whatever object was being stored in the container.

	  erousseau This was a reasonable enhancement request, which was

	  seconds are billed for, if the microseconds field on the end time
	  is greater than the microseconds field for the answer time, add
	  one second to the billsec field. The implementation was requested
	  by erousseau, and I've implemented it as requested. I've updated
	  the CHANGES, the cdr.conf.sample, and the .h files accordingly,
	  to accept and set a flag for the corresponding new option. cdr.c

	  thread is sleeping. However, there was a race condition such that
	  a newly scheduled task would not properly wake up the scheduler
	  or affect the wake up period. The order of execution would have
	  been: 1) Scheduler thread determines wake up time of N ms. 2)
	  Another thread schedules a task and signals the condition, with
	  an execution time of < N ms. 3) Scheduler thread locks and goes
	  to sleep for N ms. By moving the sleep time determination to

	  murf THis is a bold move for a static release fix, but I wouldn't
	  have made it if I didn't feel confident (at least a *bit*
	  confident) that it wouldn't mess everyone up. The reasoning goes
	  something like this: 1. We simply cannot do anything with CDR's
	  at the current point (in pbx.c, after the __ast_pbx_run loop).
	  It's way too late to have any affect on the CDRs. The CDR is
	  already posted and gone, and the remnants have been cleared. 2. I
	  was very much afraid that moving the running of the 'h' extension
	  down into the bridge code (where it would be now practical to do
	  it), would result in a lot more calls to the 'h' exten, so I
	  implemented it as another exten under another name, but found, to
	  my pleasant surprise, that there was a 1:1 correspondence to the
	  running of the 'h' exten in the pbx_run loop, and the new spot at
	  the end of the bridge. So, I ifdef'd out the current 'h' loop,
	  and moved it into the bridge code. The only difference I can see
	  is the stuff about the AST_PBX_KEEPALIVE, and hopefully, if this
	  is still an important decision point, I can replicate it if there
	  are complaints. To be perfectly honest, the KEEPALIVE situation
	  is not totally clear to me, and how it relates to a post-bridge
	  situation is less clear. I suspect the users will point out
	  everything in total clarity if this steps on anyone's toes! 3. I
	  temporarily swap the bridge_cdr into the channel before running
	  the 'h' exten, which makes it possible for users to edit the cdr
	  before it goes out the door. And, of course, with the
	  endbeforehexten config var set, the users can also get at the
	  billsec/duration vals. After the h exten finishes, the cdr is
	  swapped back and processing continues as normal. Please, all who
	  deal with CDR's, please test this version of Asterisk, and file
	  bug reports as appropriate! ........ I also made a little fix to
	  the app_dial's 'e' option, that is related to my updates.

	  of the chanspy_ds lock to ensure that no other threads still have
	  it locked. While this should not happen under normal
	  circumstances, it appears that if the spyer and spyee hang up at
	  nearly the same time, the following may occur. 1.
	  ast_channel_free is called on the spyee's channel. 2. The chanspy
	  datastore is removed from the spyee's channel in
	  ast_channel_free. 3. In the spyer's thread, the spyer attempts to
	  remove and destroy the datastore from the spyee channel, but the
	  datastore has already been removed in step 2, so the spyer
	  continues in the code. 4. The spyee's thread continues and calls
	  the datastore's destroy callback, chanspy_ds_destroy. This
	  involves locking the chanspy_ds. 5. Now the spyer attempts to
	  destroy the chanspy_ds lock. The problem is that in step 4, the
	  spyee has locked this lock, meaning that the spyer is attempting
	  to destroy a lock which is currently locked by another thread.
	  The backtrace provided in issue #12969 supports the idea that
	  this is possible (and has even occurred). This commit does not
	  close the issue, but should help in preventing one type of crash
	  associated with the use of app_chanspy. ........

	* main/pbx.c, res/ael/ael.tab.c, res/ael/ael.y, res/ael/ael.tab.h:
	  These changes are in regards to bug 13249, where users are being
	  surprised by the changes made to the Set app in trunk/1.6.x, as
	  they come from the 1.4 world. They are only bitten if they write
	  their AEL dialplan in the 1.4 world, and then carry it over to a
	  trunk/1.6.x installation where a "make samples" was executed, or
	  where they hand-edited the asterisk.conf file and added the
	  [compat] category with app_set = 1.6 (or higher). (this commit
	  does not totally solve 13249, at least not yet) The change
	  involves issueing a single warning while the AEL file is loading,
	  if: 1. app_set is present in the config file, and set to 1.6 or
	  higher. 2. there are double quotes in an assignment statement (eg
	  x = "hi there";) 3. the warning was not already issued. The
	  standalone app, aelparse, does not (yet) issue this warning. I'd
	  have to have it read in the asterisk.conf file, and that's a bit
	  of hassle. I'll add it if users request it, tho.
