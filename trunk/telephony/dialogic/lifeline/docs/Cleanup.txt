Paycode and user record cleanup (general method) 2006/02/05

The best way to clean up these files is to make a text backup, 
clear out old records from the text backup, rebuild the text backup
back into the paycode.dat and users.dat files.

Notes:
In edit mode press Alt-O to prevent users from changing data in the
paycode.dat and users.dat files. 

Be careful how you edit the text files (paycode.csv and users.csv). Excel
has a nasty habit of modifying the date formats such that they may not 
be converted back properly. The main date formats in excel should work.

Use the llrestor.exe program to convert users.csv back to users.new. Back
up users.dat and copy users.new over to users.dat.

Use the llpayres.exe program to convert paycode.csv back to paycode.new.
Back up paycode.dat and copy paycode.new over paycode.dat.

You will have to restart the program before your changes will take effect.

You will have to recreate the admin password. (Press 0*** then 1234 
then # to change the admin password.)

Do a text backup from Lifeline (tab (password), Alt-B, Alt-C)
Copy the backup to the webserver (double click the VM_BACKUP.pl icon
or type 
perl C:\files\voicemail\backups\bin\VM_BACKUP.pl 
in a msdos window.)
